Abstract
Several recent stochastic parsers use bilexical
grammars, where each word type idiosyncrat-
ically prefers particular complements with par-
ticular head words. We present O(n4) parsing
algorithms for two bilexical formalisms, improv-
ing the prior upper bounds of O(n5). For a com-
mon special case that was known to allow O(n3)
parsing (Eisner, 1997), we present an O(n 3) al-
gorithm with an improved grammar constant.
1 Introduction
Lexicalized grammar formalisms are of both
theoretical and practical interest to the com-
putational linguistics community. Such for-
malisms specify syntactic facts about each word
of the language--in particular, the type of
arguments that the word can or must take.
Early mechanisms of this sort included catego-
rial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953) and subcatego-
rization frames (Chomsky, 1965). Other lexi-
calized formalisms include (Schabes et al., 1988;
Mel\'~uk, 1988; Pollard and Sag, 1994).
Besides the possible arguments of a word, a
natural-language grammar does well to specify
possible head words for those arguments. "Con-
vene" requires an NP object, but some NPs are
more semantically or lexically appropriate here
than others, and the appropriateness depends
largely on the NP\'s head (e.g., "meeting"). We
use the general term bilexical for a grammar
that records such facts. A bilexical grammar
makes many stipulations about the compatibil-
ity of particular pairs of words in particular
roles. The acceptability of "Nora convened the

party" then depends on the grammar writer\'s
assessment of whether parties can be convened.
Several recent real-world parsers have im-
proved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by re-
lying on probabilistic or weighted versions of
bilexical grammars (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner,
1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997). The ra-
tionale is that soft selectional restrictions play
a crucial role in disambiguation, i
The chart parsing algorithms used by most of
the above authors run in time O(nS), because
bilexical grammars are enormous (the part of
the grammar relevant to a length-n input has
size O(n2) in practice). Heavy probabilistic
pruning is therefore needed to get acceptable
runtimes. But in this paper we show that the
complexity is not so bad after all:
 For bilexicalized context-free grammars,
O(n4) is possible.
 The O(n4) result also holds for head au-
tomaton grammars.
 For a very common special case of these
grammars where an O(n 3) algorithm was
previously known (Eisner, 1997), the gram-
mar constant can be reduced without
harming the O(n3) property.
Our algorithmic technique throughout is to pro-
pose new kinds of subderivations that are not
constituents. We use dynamic programming to
assemble such subderivations into a full parse.

\x0clows (Harrison, 1978; Hopcroft and Ullman,
1979). A context-free grammar (CFG) is a tuple
G = (VN,VT, P, S), where VN and VT are finite,
disjoint sets of nonterminal and terminal sym-
bols, respectively, and S E VN is the start sym-
bol. Set P is a finite set of productions having
the form A --+ a, where A E VN,a E (VNUVT)*.
If every production in P has the form A -+ BC
or A --+ a, for A,B,C E VN,a E VT, then the
grammar is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form
(CNF). 2 Every language that can be generated
by a CFG can also be generated by a CFG in
CNF.
In this paper we adopt the following conven-
tions: a, b, c, d denote symbols in VT, w, x, y de-
note strings in V~, and a, ~,... denote strings
in (VN t_JVT)*. The input to the parser will be a
CFG G together with a string of terminal sym-
bols to be parsed, w = did2.., dn. Also h,i,j,k
denote positive integers, which are assumed to
be ~ n when we are treating them as indices
into w. We write wi,j for the input substring
di\'." dj (and put wi,j = e for i > j).
A "derives" relation, written =~, is associated
with a CFG as usual. We also use the reflexive
and transitive closure of o, written ~*, and
define L(G) accordingly. We write a fl 5 =~*
a75 for a derivation in which only fl is rewritten.
3 Bilexical context-free grammars
We introduce next a grammar formalism that
captures lexical dependencies among pairs of
words in VT. This formalism closely resem-
bles stochastic grammatical formalisms that are
used in several existing natural language pro-
cessing systems (see 1). We will specify a non-
stochastic version, noting that probabilities or
other weights may be attached to the rewrite
rules exactly as in stochastic CFG (Gonzales
and Thomason, 1978; Wetherell, 1980). (See
4 for brief discussion.)
Suppose G = (VN,VT, P,T[$]) is a CFG in
CNF. 3 We say that G is bilexical iff there exists
a set of "delexicalized nonterminals" VD such
that VN = {A[a] : A E VD,a E VT} and every
production in P has one of the following forms:
2Production S --~ e is also allowed in a CNF grammar
if S never appears on the right side of any production.
However, S --+ e is not allowed in our bilexical CFGs.
,awe have a more general definition that drops the
restriction to CNF, but do not give it here.
 A[a] ~ B[b] C[a] (1)
 A[a] --+ C[a] B[b] (2)
 A[a] ~ a (3)
Thus every nonterminal is lexicalized at some
terminal a. A constituent of nonterminal type
A[a] is said to have terminal symbol a as its lex-
ical head, "inherited" from the constituent\'s
head child in the parse tree (e.g., C[a]).
Notice that the start symbol is necessarily a
lexicalized nonterminal, T[$]. Hence $ appears
in every string of L(G); it is usually convenient
to define G so that the language of interest is
actually L\'(G) = {x: x$ E L(G)}.
Such a grammar can encode lexically specific
preferences. For example, P might contain the
productions
 VP [solve] --+ V[solve] NP[puzzles]
 NP[puzzles] --+ DEW[two] N[puzzles]
 V[solve] ~ solve
 N[puzzles] --4 puzzles
 DEW[two] --+ two
in order to allow the derivation VP[solve] ~*
solve two puzzles, but meanwhile omit the sim-
ilar productions
 VP[eat] -+ V[eat] NP[puzzles]
 VP[solve] --~ V[solve] NP[goat]
 VP[sleep] -+ V[sleep] NP[goat]
 NP[goat] -+ DET[two] N[goat]
since puzzles are not edible, a goat is not solv-
able, "sleep" is intransitive, and "goat" cannot
take plural determiners. (A stochastic version
of the grammar could implement "soft prefer-
ences" by allowing the rules in the second group
but assigning them various low probabilities.)
The cost of this expressiveness is a very large
grammar. Standard context-free parsing algo-
rithms are inefficient in such a case. The CKY
algorithm (Younger, 1967; Aho and Ullman,
1972) is time O(n3. IPI), where in the worst case
IPI = [VNI3 (one ignores unary productions).
For a bilexical grammar, the worst case is IPI =
IVD13.IVT12, which is large for a large vocabulary
VT. We may improve the analysis somewhat by
observing that when parsing dl ... dn, the CKY
algorithm only considers nonterminals of the
form A[di]; by restricting to the relevant pro-
ductions we obtain O(n 3. IVDI3. min(n, IVTI)2).
458
\x0cWe observe that in practical applications we
always have n << IVTI. Let us then restrict
our analysis to the (infinite) set of input in-
stances of the parsing problem that satisfy re-
lation n < IVTI. With this assumption, the
asymptotic time complexity of the CKY algo-
rithm becomes O(n5. IVDt3). In other words,
it is a factor of n 2 slower than a comparable
non-lexicalized CFG.
4 Bilexical CFG in time O(n 4)
In this section we give a recognition algorithm
for bilexical CNF context-free grammars, which
runs in time O(n4. max(p, IVDI2)) = O(n4.
IVDI3). Here p is the maximum number of pro-
ductions sharing the same pair of terminal sym-
bols (e.g., the pair (b, a) in production (1)). The
new algorithm is asymptotically more efficient
than the CKY algorithm, when restricted to in-
put instances satisfying the relation n < IVTI.
Where CKY recognizes only constituent sub-
strings of the input, the new algorithm can rec-
ognize three types of subderivations, shown and
described in Figure l(a). A declarative specifi-
cation of the algorithm is given in Figure l(b).
The derivability conditions of (a) are guaran-
teed by (b), by induction, and the correctness of
the acceptance condition (see caption) follows.
This declarative specification, like CKY, may
be implemented by bottom-up dynamic pro-
gramming. We sketch one such method. For
each possible item, as shown in (a), we maintain
a bit (indexed by the parameters of the item)
that records whether the item has been derived
yet. All these bits are initially zero. The algo-
rithm makes a single pass through the possible
items, setting the bit for each if it can be derived
using any rule in (b) from items whose bits are
already set. At the end of this pass it is straight-
forward to test whether to accept w (see cap-
tion). The pass considers the items in increas-
ing order of width, where the width of an item
in (a) is defined as max{h,i,j} -min{h,i,j}.
Among items of the same width, those of type
A should be considered last.
The algorithm requires space proportional to
the number of possible items, which is at most
na]VDI2. Each of the five rule templates can
instantiate its free variables in at most n4p or
(for COMPLETE rules) n41VDI2 different ways,
each of which is tested once and in constant
time; so the runtime is O(n4max(p, IVDI2)).
By comparison, the CKY algorithm uses only
the first type of item, and relies on rules whose
B C
inputs are pairs .~.~ . z~::~ . Such rules
can be instantiated in O(n5) different ways for a
fixed grammar, yielding O(n 5) time complexity.
The new algorithm saves a factor of n by com-
bining those two constituents in two steps, one
of which is insensitive to k and abstracts over its
possible values, the other of which is insensitive
to h~and abstracts over its possible values.
It is straightforward to turn the new O(n 4)
recognition algorithm into a parser for stochas-
tic bilexical CFGs (or other weighted bilexical
CFGs). In a stochastic CFG, each nonterminal
A[a] is accompanied by a probability distribu-
tion over productions of the form A[a] --+~. A
T
is just a derivation (proof tree) of lZ~n
,.o
parse
and its probability--like that of any derivation
we find--is defined as the product of the prob-
abilities of all productions used to condition in-
ference rules in the proof tree. The highest-
probability derivation for any item can be re-
constructed recursively at the end of the parse,
provided that each item maintains not only a
bit indicating whether it can be derived, but
also the probability and instantiated root rule
of its highest-probability derivation tree.
5 A more efficient variant
We now give a variant of the algorithm of 4; the
variant has the same asymptotic complexity but
will often be faster in practice.
Notice that the ATTACH-LEFT rule of Fig-
ure l(b) tries to combine the nonterminal label
B[dh,] of a previously derived constituent with
every possible nonterminal label of the form
C[dh]. The improved version, shown in Figure 2,
restricts C[dh]to be the label of a previously de-
rived adjacent constituent. This improves speed
if there are not many such constituents and we
can enumerate them in O(1) time apiece (using
a sparse parse table to store the derived items).
It is necessary to use an agenda data struc-
ture (Kay, 1986) when implementing the declar-
ative algorithm of Figure 2. Deriving narrower
items before wider ones as before will not work
here because the rule HALVE derives narrow
items from wide ones.

\x0c6 Multiple word senses
Rather than parsing an input string directly, it
is often desirable to parse another string related
by a (possibly stochastic) transduction. Let T
be a finite-state transducer that maps a mor-
pheme sequence w E V~ to its orthographic re-
alization, a grapheme sequence v~. T may re-
alize arbitrary morphological processes, includ-
ing affixation, local clitic movement, deletion
of phonological nulls, forbidden or dispreferred
k-grams, typographical errors, and mapping of
multiple senses onto the same grapheme. Given
grammar G and an input @, we ask whether
E T(L(G)). We have extended all the algo-
rithms in this paper to this case: the items sim-
ply keep track of the transducer state as well.
Due to space constraints, we sketch only the
special case of multiple senses. Suppose that
the input is ~ =dl ... dn, and each di has up to
g possible senses. Each item now needs to track
its head\'s sense along with its head\'s position in
@. Wherever an item formerly recorded a head
position h (similarly h~), it must now record a
pair (h, dh) , where dh E VT is a specific sense of
d-h. No rule in Figures 1-2 (or Figure 3 below)
will mention more than two such pairs. So the
time complexity increases by a factor of O(g2).
7 Head automaton grammars in
time O(n 4)
In this section we show that a length-n string
generated by a head automaton grammar (A1-
shawi, 1996) can be parsed in time O(n4). We
do this by providing a translation from head
automaton grammars to bilexical CFGs. 4 This
result improves on the head-automaton parsing
algorithm given by Alshawi, which is analogous
to the CKY algorithm on bilexical CFGs and is
likewise O(n 5) in practice (see 3).
A head automaton grammar (HAG) is a
function H : a ~ Ha that defines a head au-
tomaton (HA) for each element of its (finite)
domain. Let VT =- domain(H) and D = {~, +--
-}. A special symbol $ E VT plays the role of
start symbol. For each a E VT, Ha is a tuple
(Qa, VT, (~a,In, Fa), where
 Qa is a finite set of states;
4Translation in the other direction is possible if the
HAG formalism is extended to allow multiple senses per
word (see 6). This makes the formalisms equivalent.
 In, Fa C Qa are sets of initial and final
states, respectively;
 5a is a transition function mapping Qa x
VT  D to 2Qa, the power set of Qa.
A single head automaton is an acceptor for a
language of string pairs (z~,Zr) E V~ x V~. In-
formally, if b is the leftmost symbol of Zr and
q~E 5a(q, b, -~), then Ha can move from state q
to state q~, matching symbol b and removing it
from the left end of Zr. Symmetrically, if b is the
rightmost symbol of zl and ql E 5a(q, b, ~---) then
from q Ha can move to q~, matching symbol b
and removing it from the right end of zl.5
More formally, we associate with the head au-
tomaton Ha a "derives" relation F-a, defined as
a binary relation on Qa  V~ x V~. For ev-
ery q E Q, x,y E V~, b E VT, d E D, and
q\' E ~a(q, b, d), we specify that
(q, xb, y) ~-a (q\',x,Y) if d =+-;
(q, x, by) ~-a (q\', x, y) if d =--+.
The reflexive and transitive closure of F-a is writ-
ten ~-~. The language generated by Ha is the set
L(Ha) = {<zl,Zr) I (q, zl,Zr) I-; (r,e,e),
qEIa, rEFa}.
We may now define the language generated
by the entire grammar H. To generate, we ex-
pand the start word $ E VT into xSy for some
(x, y) E L(H$), and then recursively expand the
words in strings x and y. More formally, given
H, we simultaneously define La for all a E VT
to be minimal such that if (x,y) E L(Ha),
xr E Lx, yl ELy, then x~ay~ E La, where
Lal...ak stands for the concatenation language
Lal "\'" La k. Then H generates language L$.
We next present a simple construction that
transforms a HAG H into a bilexical CFG G
generating the same language. The construc-
tion also preserves derivation ambiguity. This
means that for each string w, there is a linear-
time 1-to-1 mapping between (appropriately de-
~Alshawi (1996) describes HAs as accepting (or equiv-
alently, generating) zl and z~ from the outside in. To
make Figure 3 easier to follow, we have defined HAs as
accepting symbols in the opposite order, from the in-
side out. This amounts to the same thing if transitions
are reversed, Is is exchanged with Fa, and any transi-
tion probabilities are replaced by those of the reversed
Markov chain.
461
\x0cfined) canonical derivations of w by H and
canonical derivations of w by G.
We adopt the notation above for H and the
components of its head automata. Let VD be
an arbitrary set of size t = max{[Qa[ : a  VT},
and for each a, define an arbitrary injection fa :
Qa --+ YD. We define G -- (VN, VT, P,T[$]),
where
(i) VN = {A[a] : A  VD, a  VT}, in the usual
manner for bilexical CFG;
(ii) P is the set of all productions having one
of the following forms, where a, b  VT:
 A[a] --+ B[b] C[a] where
A = fa(r), B = fb(q\'), C = f~(q) for
some qr  Ib, q  Qa, r  5a(q, b, +-)
 A[a] -~ C[a] Bib] where
A = fa(r), B = fb(q\'), C = fa(q) for
some q\'  Ib, q  Qa, r  5a(q, b,--+)
]
 A[a --+ a where
A = fa(q) for some q  Fa
(iii) T = f$(q), where we assume WLOG that
I$ is a singleton set {q}.
We omit the formal proof that G and H
admit isomorphic derivations and hence gen-
erate the same languages, observing only that
if (x,y) = (bib2... bj, bj+l.., bk) E L(Ha)--
a condition used in defining La above--then
g[a] 3" BI[bl]"" Bj[bj]aBj+l[bj+l]... Bk[bk],
for any A, B1,... Bk that map to initial states
in Ha, Hbl,... Hb~ respectively.
In general, G has p = O(IVDI3) = O(t3). The
construction therefore implies that we can parse
a length-n sentence under H in time O(n4t3). If
the HAs in H happen to be deterministic, then
in each binary production given by (ii) above,
symbol A is fully determined by a, b, and C. In
this case p = O(t2), so the parser will operate
in time O(n4t2).
We note that this construction can be
straightforwardly extended to convert stochas-
tic HAGs as in (Alshawi, 1996) into stochastic
CFGs. Probabilities that Ha assigns to state q\'s
various transition and halt actions are copied
onto the corresponding productions A[a] --~ c~
of G, where A = fa(q).
8 Split head automaton grammars
in time O(n 3)
For many bilexical CFGs or HAGs of practical
significance, just as for the bilexical version of
link grammars (Lafferty et al., 1992), it is possi-
ble to parse length-n inputs even faster, in time
O(n 3) (Eisner, 1997). In this section we de-
scribe and discuss this special case, and give a
new O(n 3) algorithm that has a smaller gram-
mar constant than previously reported.
A head automaton Ha is called split if it has
no states that can be entered on a +-- transi-
tion and exited on a ~ transition. Such an au-
tomaton can accept (x, y) only by reading all of
y--immediately after which it is said to be in
a flip state--and then reading all of x. For-
mally, a flip state is one that allows entry on a
--+ transition and that either allows exit on a e--
transition or is a final state.
We are concerned here with head automa-
ton grammars H such that every Ha is split.
These correspond to bilexical CFGs in which
any derivation A[a] 3" xay has the form
A[a] 3" xB[a] =~* xay. That is, a word\'s left
dependents are more oblique than its right de-
pendents and c-command them.
Such grammars are broadly applicable. Even
if Ha is not split, there usually exists a split head
automaton H~ recognizing the same language.
H a\' exists iff {x#y : {x,y) e L(Ha)} is regular
(where #  VT). In particular, H~a must exist
unless Ha has a cycle that includes both +-- and
--+ transitions. Such cycles would be necessary
for Ha itself to accept a formal language such
as {(bn, cn) : n > 0}, where word a takes 2n de-
pendents, but we know of no natural-language
motivation for ever using them in a HAG.
One more definition will help us bound the
complexity. A split head automaton Ha is said
to be g-split if its set of flip states, denoted
Qa C_Qa, has size < g. The languages that can
be recognized by g-split HAs are those that can
g
be written as [Ji=l Li x Ri, where the Li and
Ri are regular languages over VT. Eisner (1997)
actually defined (g-split) bilexical grammars in
terms of the latter property. 6
6That paper associated a product language Li x Ri, or
equivalently a 1-split HA, with each ofg senses of a word
(see 6). One could do the same without penalty in our
present approach: confining to l-split automata would
remove the g2 complexity factor, and then allowing g
462
\x0cWe now present our result: Figure 3 specifies
an O(n3g2t2) recognition algorithm for a head
automaton grammar H in which every Ha is
g-split. For deterministic automata, the run-
time is O(n3g2t)--a considerable improvement
on the O(n3g3t2) result of (Eisner, 1997), which
also assumes deterministic automata. As in 4,
a simple bottom-up implementation will suffice.
s
For a practical speedup, add . ["\'. as an an-
h j
tecedent to the MID rule (and fill in the parse
table from right to left).
Like our previous algorithms, this one takes
two steps (ATTACH, COMPLETE) to attach a
child constituent to a parent constituent. But
instead of full constituents--strings xd~y E
Ld~--it uses only half-constituents like xdi and
diy. Where CKY combines z~
i h jj+ln
we save two degrees of freedom i, k (so improv-
ing O(n 5) to O(n3)) and combine, ,~:~...~J;
n 2J~1 n
The other halves of these constituents can be at-
tached later, because to find an accepting path
for (zl, Zr) in a split head automaton, one can
separately find the half-path before the flip state
(which accepts zr) and the half-path after the
flip state (which accepts zt). These two half-
paths can subsequently be joined into an ac-
cepting path if they have the same flip state s,
i.e., one path starts where the other ends. An-
notating our left half-constituents with s makes
this check possible.
9 Final remarks
We have formally described, and given faster
parsing algorithms for, three practical gram-
matical rewriting systems that capture depen-
dencies between pairs of words. All three sys-
tems admit naive O(n 5) algorithms. We give
the first O(n 4) results for the natural formalism
of bilexical context-free grammar, and for AI-
shawi\'s (1996) head automaton grammars. For
the usual case, split head automaton grammars
or equivalent bilexical CFGs, we replace the
O(n3) algorithm of (Eisner, 1997) by one with a
smaller grammar constant. Note that, e.g., all
senses would restore the g2 factor. Indeed, this approach
gives added flexibility: a word\'s sense, unlike its choice
of flip state, is visible to the HA that readsit.
three models in (Collins, 1997) are susceptible
to the O(n 3) method (cf. Collins\'s O(nh)).
Our dynamic programming techniques for
cheaply attaching head information to deriva-
tions can also be exploited in parsing formalisms
other than rewriting systems. The authors have
developed an O(nT)-time parsing algorithm for
bilexicalized tree adjoining grammars (Schabes,
1992), improving the naive O(n s) method.
The results mentioned in 6 are related to the
closure property of CFGs under generalized se-
quential machine mapping (Hopcroft and Ull-
man, 1979). This property also holds for our
class of bilexical CFGs.

Figure 3: An O(n 3) recognition algorithm for split head automaton grammars. The format is as
in Figure 1, except that (c) gives the acceptance condition. The following notation indicates that
a head automaton can consume a string x from its left or right input: a : q x) qr means that
(q, e, x) ~-a (q\', e, c), and a : I x ~ q, means this is true for some q E Ia. Similarly, a : q\' ~x q means
that (q, x, e) t-* (q~, c, c), and a : F (x q means this is true for some q~ E Fa. The special symbol
F also appears as a literal in some items, and effectively means "an unspecified final state."
