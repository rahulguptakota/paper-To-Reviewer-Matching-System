We present a fully automatic method for
content selection evaluation in summariza-
tion that does not require the creation of
human model summaries. Our work capi-
talizes on the assumption that the distribu-
tion of words in the input and an informa-
tive summary of that input should be sim-
ilar to each other. Results on a large scale
evaluation from the Text Analysis Con-
ference show that input-summary compar-
isons are very effective for the evaluation
of content selection. Our automatic meth-
ods rank participating systems similarly
to manual model-based pyramid evalua-
tion and to manual human judgments of
responsiveness. The best feature, Jensen-
Shannon divergence, leads to a correlation
as high as 0.88 with manual pyramid and
0.73 with responsiveness evaluations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999074354166666">
The most commonly used evaluation method for
summarization during system development and
for reporting results in publications is the auto-
matic evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004; Lin
and Hovy, 2003). ROUGE compares system sum-
maries against one or more model summaries
by computing n-gram word overlaps between the
two. The wide adoption of such automatic mea-
sures is understandable because they are conve-
nient and greatly reduce the complexity of eval-
uations. ROUGE scores also correlate well with
manual evaluations of content based on compar-
ison with a single model summary, as used in
the early editions of the Document Understanding
Conferences (Over et al., 2007).
In our work, we take the idea of automatic
evaluation to an extreme and explore the feasi-
bility of developing a fully automatic evaluation
method for content selection that does not make
use of human model summaries at all. To this end,
we show that evaluating summaries by comparing
them with the input obtains good correlations with
manual evaluations for both query focused and up-
date summarization tasks.
Our results have important implications for fu-
ture development of summarization systems and
their evaluation.
High correlations between system ranking pro-
duced with the fully automatic method and
manual evaluations show that the new eval-
uation measures can be used during system
development when human model summaries
are not available.
Our results provide validation of several features
that can be optimized in the development of
new summarization systems when the objec-
tive is to improve content selection on aver-
age, over a collection of test inputs. However,
none of the features is consistently predictive
of good summary content for individual in-
puts.
We find that content selection performance on
standard test collections can be approximated
well by the proposed fully automatic method.
This result greatly underlines the need to re-
quire linguistic quality evaluations alongside
content selection ones in future evaluations
and research.

2 Model-free methods for evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992663666666667">
Proposals for developing fully automatic methods
for summary evaluation have been put forward
in the past. Their attractiveness is obvious for
large scale evaluations, or for evaluation on non-
standard test sets for which human models are not
available.

\x0cFor example in Radev et al. (2003), a large
scale fully automatic evaluation of eight summa-
rization systems on 18,000 documents was per-
formed without any human effort. A search engine
was used to rank documents according to their rel-
evance to a given query. The summaries for each
document were also ranked for relevance with re-
spect to the same query. For good summariza-
tion systems, the relevance ranking of summaries
is expected to be similar to that of the full docu-
ments. Based on this intuition, the correlation be-
tween relevance rankings of summaries and orig-
inal documents was used to compare the different
systems. The approach was motivated by the as-
sumption that the distribution of terms in a good
summary is similar to the distribution of terms in
the original document.
Even earlier, Donaway et al. (2000) suggested
that there are considerable benefits to be had in
adopting model-free methods of evaluation involv-
ing direct comparisons between the original docu-
ment and its summary. The motivation for their
work was the considerable variation in content se-
lection choices in model summaries (Rath et al.,
1961). The identity of the model writer signifi-
cantly affects summary evaluations (also noted by
McKeown et al. (2001), Jing et al. (1998)) and
evaluations of the same systems can be rather dif-
ferent when different models are used. In their
experiments, Donaway et al. (2000) demonstrated
that the correlations between manual evaluation
using a model summary and
a) manual evaluation using a different model
summary
b) automatic evaluation by directly comparing
input and summary1,
are the same. Their conclusion was that such au-
tomatic methods should be seriously considered as
an alternative to model based evaluation.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive study
of fully automatic summary evaluation without
any human models. A summarys content is
judged for quality by directly estimating its close-
ness to the input. We compare several probabilistic
and information-theoretic approaches for charac-
terizing the similarity and differences between in-
put and summary content. A simple information-
theoretic measure, Jensen Shannon divergence be-
tween input and summary, emerges as the best fea-

3.1 Query-focused and Update Summaries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994035">
Two types of summaries, query-focused and up-
date summaries, were evaluated in the summariza-
tion track of the 2008 Text Analysis Conference
(TAC)2. Query-focused summaries were produced
from input documents in response to a stated user
information need. The update summaries require
more sophistication: two sets of articles on the
same topic are provided. The first set of articles
represents the background of a story and users are
assumed to be already familiar with the informa-
tion contained in them. The update task is to pro-
duce a multi-document summary from the second
set of articles that can serve as an update to the
user. This task is reminiscent of the novelty de-
tection task explored at TREC (Soboroff and Har-
man, 2005).

3.2 Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996433818181818">
The test set for the TAC 2008 summarization task
contains 48 inputs. Each input consists of two sets
of 10 documents each, called docsets A and B.
Both A and B are on the same general topic but
B contains documents published later than those
in A. In addition, the users information need as-
sociated with each input is given by a query state-
ment consisting of a title and narrative. An exam-
ple query statement is shown below.
Title: Airbus A380
Narrative: Describe developments in the pro-
duction and launch of the Airbus A380.
A system must produce two summaries: (1) a
query-focused summary of docset A, (2) a compi-
lation of updates from docset B, assuming that the
user has read all the documents in A. The max-
imum length for both types of summaries is 100
words.
There were 57 participating systems in TAC
2008. We use the summaries and evaluations of
these systems for the experiments reported in the
paper.

produced by the systems.
Pyramid evaluation: The pyramid evaluation
method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) has been
developed for reliable and diagnostic assessment
of content selection quality in summarization and
has been used in several large scale evaluations
(Nenkova et al., 2007). It uses multiple human
models from which annotators identify seman-
tically defined Summary Content Units (SCU).
Each SCU is assigned a weight equal to the
number of human model summaries that express
that SCU. An ideal maximally informative sum-
mary would express a subset of the most highly
weighted SCUs, with multiple maximally infor-
mative summaries being possible. The pyramid
score for a system summary is equal to the ratio
between the sum of weights of SCUs expressed
in a summary (again identified manually) and the
sum of weights of an ideal summary with the same
number of SCUs.
Four human summaries provided by NIST for
each input and task were used for the pyramid
evaluation at TAC.
Responsiveness evaluation: Responsiveness of a
summary is a measure of overall quality combin-
ing both content selection and linguistic quality:
summaries must present useful content in a struc-
tured fashion in order to better satisfy the users
need. Assessors directly assigned scores on a
scale of 1 (poor summary) to 5 (very good sum-
mary) to each summary. These assessments are
done without reference to any model summaries.
The (Spearman) correlation between the pyramid
and responsiveness metrics is high but not perfect:
0.88 and 0.92 respectively for query focused and
update summarization.
ROUGE evaluation: NIST also evaluated the
summaries automatically using ROUGE (Lin,
2004; Lin and Hovy, 2003). Comparison between
a summary and the set of four model summaries
is computed using unigram (R1) and bigram over-
laps (R2)3. The correlations between ROUGE and
manual evaluations is shown in Table 1 and varies
between 0.80 and 0.94.
Linguistic quality evaluation: Assessors scored
summaries on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very
good) for five factors of linguistic quality: gram-
maticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, fo-
cus, structure and coherence.
We do not make use of any of the linguistic
quality evaluations. Our work focuses on fully au-
tomatic evaluation of content selection, so man-
ual pyramid and responsiveness scores are used
for comparison with our automatic method. The
pyramid metric measures content selection exclu-
sively, while responsiveness incorporates at least
some aspects of linguistic quality.

4 Features for content evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990615">
We describe three classes of features to compare
input and summary content: distributional simi-
larity, summary likelihood and use of topic signa-
tures. Both input and summary words were stop-
word filtered and stemmed before computing the
features.

4.1 Distributional Similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987234863636364">
Measures of similarity between two probability
distributions are a natural choice for the task at
hand. One would expect good summaries to be
characterized by low divergence between proba-
bility distributions of words in the input and sum-
mary, and by high similarity with the input.
We experimented with three common measures:
KL and Jensen Shannon divergence and cosine
similarity. These three metrics have already been
applied for summary evaluation, albeit in differ-
ent contexts. In Lin et al. (2006), KL and JS di-
vergences between human and machine summary
distributions were used to evaluate content selec-
tion. The study found that JS divergence always
outperformed KL divergence. Moreover, the per-
formance of JS divergence was better than stan-
dard ROUGE scores for multi-document summa-
rization when multiple human models were used
for the comparison.
The use of cosine similarity in Donaway et
al. (2000) is more directly related to our work.
They show that the difference between evaluations

\x0cbased on two different human models is about the
same as the difference between system ranking
based on one model summary and the ranking pro-
duced using input-summary similarity. Inputs and
summaries were compared using only one metric:
cosine similarity.
Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence: The KL di-
vergence between two probability distributions P
and Q is given by

It is defined as the average number of bits wasted
by coding samples belonging to P using another
distribution Q, an approximate of P. In our case,
the two distributions are those for words in the
input and summary respectively. Since KL di-
vergence is not symmetric, both input-summary
and summary-input divergences are used as fea-
tures. In addition, the divergence is undefined
when pP (w) &amp;gt; 0 but pQ(w) = 0. We perform
simple smoothing to overcome the problem.

number of tokens; B = 1.5|V |, where V is the
input vocabulary and was set to a small value
of 0.0005 to avoid shifting too much probability
mass to unseen events.
Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence: The JS diver-
gence incorporates the idea that the distance be-
tween two distributions cannot be very different
from the average of distances from their mean dis-
tribution. It is formally defined as

2 is the mean distribution of P

tance is symmetric and always defined. We use
both smoothed and unsmoothed versions of the di-
vergence as features.

third metric is cosine overlap between the tf idf

Topic signatures are words highly descriptive of
the input, as determined by the application of log-

topic signatures from the input to represent text is
expected to be more accurate because the reduced

Summarization systems that directly optimize for
more topic signatures during content selection
have fared very well in evaluations (Conroy et al.,
2006). Hence the number of topic signatures from
the input present in a summary might be a good
indicator of summary content quality. We experi-
ment with two features that quantify the presence
of topic signatures in a summary:

While both features will obtain higher values
for summaries containing many topic words, the
first is guided simply by the presence of any topic
word while the second measures the diversity of
topic words used in the summary.

5 Correlations with manual evaluations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989013818181818">
In this section, we report the correlations between
system ranking using our automatic features and
the manual evaluations. We studied the predictive
power of features in two scenarios.
MACRO LEVEL; PER SYSTEM: The values of fea-
tures were computed for each summary submitted
for evaluation. For each system, the feature values
were averaged across all inputs. All participating
systems were ranked based on the average value.
Similarly, the average manual score, pyramid or
responsiveness, was also computed for each sys-
tem. The correlations between the two rankings
are shown in Tables 2 and 4.
MICRO LEVEL; PER INPUT: The systems were
ranked for each input separately, and correlations
between the summary rankings for each input
were computed (Table 3).
The two levels of analysis address different
questions: Can we automatically identify sys-
tem performance across all test inputs (macro
level) and can we identify which summaries for a
given input were good and which were bad (mi-
cro level)? For the first task, the answer is a defi-
nite yes while for the second task the results are
mixed.
In addition, we compare our results to model-
based evaluations using ROUGE and analyze the
effects of stemming the input and summary vo-
cabularies. In order to allow for in-depth discus-
sion, we will analyze our findings only for query
focused summaries. Similar results were obtained
for the evaluation of update summaries and are de-
scribed in Section 7.

48 inputs. We find that both distributional simi-
larity and the topic signature features produce sys-
tem rankings very similar to those produced by hu-
mans. Summary probabilities, on the other hand,
turn out to be unpredictive of content selection
performance. The linear regression combination
of features obtains high correlations with manual
scores but does not lead to better results than the
single best feature: JS divergence.
JS divergence outperforms other features in-
cluding the regression metric and obtains the best
correlations with both types of manual scores, 0.88
with pyramid score and 0.74 with responsiveness.
The regression metric performs comparably with
correlations of 0.86 and 0.70. The correlations ob-
tained by both JS divergence and the regression
metric with pyramid evaluations are in fact better
than that obtained by ROUGE-1 recall (0.85).
The best topic signature based feature
percentage of inputs topic signatures that are
present in the summaryranks next only to JS di-
vergence and regression. The correlation between
this feature and pyramid and responsiveness eval-
uations is 0.79 and 0.62 respectively. The propor-
tion of summary content composed of topic words
performs worse as an evaluation metric with cor-
relations 0.71 and 0.60. This result indicates that
summaries that cover more topics from the input
are judged to have better content than those in
which fewer topics are mentioned.
Cosine overlaps and KL divergences obtain
good correlations but still lower than JS diver-
gence or percentage of input topic words. Further,
rankings based on unigram and multinomial sum-

5.2 Performance on micro level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999532414634146">
On a per input basis, the proposed metrics are not
that effective in distinguishing which summaries
have better content. The minimum and maximum
correlations with manual evaluations across the 48
inputs are given in Table 3. The number and per-
centage of inputs for which correlations were sig-
nificant are also reported.
Now, JS divergence obtains significant correla-
tions with pyramid scores for 73% of the inputs
but for particular inputs, the correlation can be
as low as 0.27. The results are worse for other
features and for comparison with responsiveness
scores.
At the micro level, combining features with re-
gression gives the best result overall, in contrast to
the findings for the macro level setting. This re-
sult has implications for system development; no
single feature can reliably predict good content for
a particular input. Even a regression combination
of all features is a significant predictor of content
selection quality in only 77% of the cases.
We should note however, that our features are
based only on the distribution of terms in the in-
put and therefore less likely to inform good con-
tent for all input types. For example, a set of
documents each describing different opinion on a
given issue will likely have less repetition on both
lexical and content unit level. The predictiveness
of features like ours will be limited for such in-
puts4. However, model summaries written for the
specific input would give better indication of what
information in the input was important and inter-
esting. This indeed is the case as we shall see in
Section 6.
Overall, the micro level results suggest that the
fully automatic measures we examined will not be
useful for providing information about summary
quality for an individual input. For averages over
many test sets, the fully automatic evaluations give
more reliable and useful results, highly correlated
with rankings produced by manual evaluations.

In fact, it would be surprising to find an automatically

able to consistently predict good content for all individual in-

would already exist.

are for JS and KL divergences with respect to re-

of words overlap features are the best predictors
of responsiveness (correlations are 0.63 and 0.64
respectively) but do not change much after stem-
ming (topic overlap0.62, bag of words0.64).
Divergences emerge as better metrics only after
stemming.
Stemming also proves beneficial for the likeli-
hood features. Before stemming, their correlations
are directed in the wrong direction, but they im-
prove after stemming to being either positive or
closer to zero. However, even after stemming,
summary probabilities are not good predictors of
content quality.

responsiveness scores
Overall, we find that correlations with pyramid
scores are higher than correlations with respon-
siveness. Clearly our features are designed to
compare input-summary content only. Since re-
sponsiveness judgements were based on both con-
tent and linguistic quality of summaries, it is not
surprising that these rankings are harder to repli-
cate using our content based features. Neverthe-
less, responsiveness scores are dominated by con-
tent quality and the correlation between respon-
siveness and JS divergence is high, 0.73.
Clearly, metrics of linguistic quality should be
integrated with content evaluations to allow for
better predictions of responsiveness. To date, few
attempts have been made to automatically eval-
uate linguistic quality in summarization. Lapata
and Barzilay (2005) proposed a method for co-
herence evaluation which holds promise but has
not been validated so far on large datasets such
as those used in TAC and DUC. In a simpler ap-
proach, Conroy and Dang (2008) use higher order
ROUGE scores to approximate both content and
linguistic quality.

<bodyText confidence="0.999371971428572">
For manual pyramid scores, the best correlation,
0.88, we observed in our experiments was with
JS divergence. This result is unexpectedly high
for a fully automatic evaluation metric. Note that
the best correlation between pyramid scores and
ROUGE (for R2) is 0.90, practically identical with
JS divergence. For ROUGE-1, the correlation is
0.85.
In the case of manual responsiveness, which
combines aspects of linguistic quality along with
content selection evaluation, the correlation with
JS divergence is 0.73. For ROUGE, it is 0.80
for R1 and 0.87 for R2. Using higher order n-
grams is obviously beneficial as observed from the
differences between unigram and bigram ROUGE
scores. So a natural extension of our features
would be to use distance between bigram distri-
butions. At the same time, for responsiveness,
ROUGE-1 outperforms all the fully automatic fea-
tures. This is evidence that the model summaries
provide information that is unlikely to ever be ap-
proximated by information from the input alone,
regardless of feature sophistication.
At the micro level, ROUGE does clearly better
than all the automatic measures. The results are
shown in the last two rows of Table 3. ROUGE-1
recall obtains significant correlations for over 95%
of inputs for responsiveness and 98% of inputs for
pyramid evaluation compared to 73% (JS diver-
gence) and 77% (regression). Undoubtedly, at the
input level, comparison with model summaries is
substantially more informative.
When reference summaries are available,
ROUGE provides scores that agree best with hu-
man judgements. However, when model sum-

In Table 4, we report the performance of our fea-
tures for system evaluation on the update task. The
column, update input only summarizes the cor-
relations obtained by features comparing the sum-
maries with only the update inputs (set B). We
also compared the summaries individually to the
update and background (set A) inputs. The two
sets of features were then combined by a) averag-
ing (avg. update and background) and b) linear
regression (last line of Table 4).
As in the case of query focused summarization,
JS divergence and percentage of input topic sig-
natures in summary are the best features for the
update task as well. The overall best feature is
JS divergence between the update input and the
summariescorrelations of 0.82 and 0.76 with
pyramid and responsiveness.
Interestingly, the features combining both up-
date and background inputs do not lead to better
correlations than those obtained using the update
input only. The best performance from combined
features is given by the linear regression metric.
Although the correlation of this regression feature
with pyramid scores (0.80) is comparable to JS di-
vergence with update inputs, its correlation with
responsiveness (0.67) is clearly lower. These re-
sults show that the term distributions in the update
input are sufficiently good predictors of content
for update summaries. The role of the background
input appears to be negligable.

8 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908283018868">
We have presented a successful framework for
model-free evaluations of content which uses the
input as reference. The power of model-free eval-
uations generalizes across at least two summariza-
tion tasks: query focused and update summariza-
tion.
We have analyzed a variety of features for input-
summary comparison and demonstrated that the
strength of different features varies considerably.
Similar term distributions in the input and the sum-
mary and diverse use of topic signatures in the
summary are highly indicative of good content.
We also find that preprocessing like stemming im-
proves the performance of KL and JS divergence
features.
Very good results were obtained from a corre-
lation analysis with human judgements, showing
that input can indeed substitute for model sum-
maries and manual efforts in summary evaluation.
The best correlations were obtained by a single
feature, JS divergence (0.88 with pyramid scores
and 0.73 with responsiveness at system level).
Our best features can therefore be used to eval-
uate the content selection performance of systems
in a new domain where model summaries are un-
available. However, like all other content evalua-
tion metrics, our features must be accompanied by
judgements of linguistic quality to obtain whole-
some indicators of summary quality and system
performance. Evidence for this need is provided
by the lower correlations with responsiveness than
the content-only pyramid evaluations.
The results of our analysis zero in on JS diver-
gence and topic signature as desirable objectives to
optimize during content selection. On the macro
level, they are powerful predictors of content qual-
ity. These findings again emphasize the need for
always including linguistic quality as a component
of evaluation.
Observations from our input-based evaluation
also have important implications for the design of
novel summarization tasks. We find that high cor-
relations with manual evaluations are obtained by
comparing query-focused summaries with the en-
tire input and making no use of the query at all.
Similarly in the update summarization task, the
best predictions of content for update summaries
were obtained using only the update input. The
uncertain role of background inputs and queries
expose possible problems with the task designs.
Under such conditions, it is not clear if query-
focused content selection or ability to compile up-
dates are appropriately captured by any evaluation.

Our work capitalizes on the assumption that the distribution of words in the input and an informative summary of that input should be similar to each other. Results on a large scale evaluation from the Text Analysis Conference show that input-summary comparisons are very effective for the evaluation of content selection. Our automatic methods rank participating systems similarly to manual model-based pyramid evaluation and to manual human judgments of responsiveness. The best feature, Jensen- Shannon divergence, leads to a correlation as high as 0.88 with manual pyramid and 0.73 with responsiveness evaluations.</abstract>

We experiment with two features that quantify the presence of topic signatures in a summary: 1. Fraction of the summary composed of inputs topic signatures. 2. Percentage of topic signatures from the input that also appear in the summary.

The motivation for their work was the considerable variation in content selection choices in model summaries (Rath et al., 1961). The identity of the model writer significantly affects summary evaluations (also noted by McKeown et al. (2001), Jing et al.

One would expect good summaries to be characterized by low divergence between probability distributions of words in the input and summary, and by high similarity with the input. We experimented with three common measures: KL and Jensen Shannon divergence and cosine similarity. These three metrics have already been applied for summary evaluation, albeit in different contexts. In Lin et al. (2006), KL and JS divergences between human and machine summary distributions were used to evaluate content selection. The study found that JS divergence always outperformed KL divergence. Moreover, the performance of JS divergence was better than standard ROUGE scores for multi-document summarization when multiple human models were used for the comparison. The use of cosine similarity in Donaway et al. (2000) is more directly related to our work.

The motivation for their work was the considerable variation in content selection choices in model summaries (Rath et al., 1961). The identity of the model writer significantly affects summary evaluations (also noted by McKeown et al. (2001), Jing et al.

This result greatly underlines the need to require linguistic quality evaluations alongside content selection ones in future evaluations and research. 2 Model-free methods for evaluation Proposals for developing fully automatic methods for summary evaluation have been put forward in the past. Their attractiveness is obvious for large scale evaluations, or for evaluation on nonstandard test sets for which human models are not available. 306 \x0cFor example in Radev et al. (2003), a large scale fully automatic evaluation of eight summarization systems on 18,000 documents was performed without any human effort. A search engine was used to rank documents according to their relevance to a given query. The summaries for each document were also ranked for relevance with respect to the same query. For good summarization systems, the relevance ranking of summaries is expected to be similar to that of the full documents. Based on this intuition, the correlation between relevance rankings of summaries and original documents was used to compare the different systems. The approa</context>

Query-focused summaries were produced from input documents in response to a stated user information need. The update summaries require more sophistication: two sets of articles on the same topic are provided. The first set of articles represents the background of a story and users are assumed to be already familiar with the information contained in them. The update task is to produce a multi-document summary from the second set of articles that can serve as an update to the user. This task is reminiscent of the novelty detection task explored at TREC (Soboroff and Harman, 2005). 3.2 Data The test set for the TAC 2008 summarization task contains 48 inputs. Each input consists of two sets of 10 documents each, called docsets A and B. Both A and B are on the same general topic but B contains documents published later than those in A. In addition, the users information need associated with each input is given by a query statement consisting of a title and narrative. An example query statement is shown below.
