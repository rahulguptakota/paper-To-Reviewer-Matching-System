Statistical translation models that try to
capture the recursive structure of language
have been widely adopted over the last few
years. These models make use of vary-
ing amounts of information from linguis-
tic theory: some use none at all, some use
information about the grammar of the tar-
get language, some use information about
the grammar of the source language. But
progress has been slower on translation
models that are able to learn the rela-
tionship between the grammars of both
the source and target language. We dis-
cuss the reasons why this has been a chal-
lenge, review existing attempts to meet this
challenge, and show how some old and
new ideas can be combined into a sim-
ple approach that uses both source and tar-
get syntax for significant improvements in
translation accuracy.

Statistical translation models that use synchronous
context-free grammars (SCFGs) or related for-
malisms to try to capture the recursive structure of
language have been widely adopted over the last
few years. The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005)
make no use of information from syntactic theo-
ries or syntactic annotations, whereas others have
successfully incorporated syntactic information on
the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al.,
2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang
et al., 2006). The next obvious step is toward mod-
els that make full use of syntactic information on
both sides. But the natural generalization to this
setting has been found to underperform phrase-
based models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and Lavie,
2008), and researchers have begun to explore so-
lutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009).
In this paper, we explore the reasons why tree-
to-tree translation has been challenging, and how
source syntax and target syntax might be used to-
gether. Drawing on previous successful attempts to
relax syntactic constraints during grammar extrac-
tion in various ways (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2009; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), we com-
pare several methods for extracting a synchronous
grammar from tree-to-tree data. One confounding
factor in such a comparison is that some methods
generate many new syntactic categories, making it
more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at de-
coding time. We therefore propose to move these
constraints from the formalism into the model, im-
plemented as features in the hierarchical phrase-
based model Hiero (Chiang, 2005). This aug-
mented model is able to learn from data whether
to rely on syntax or not, or to revert back to mono-
tone phrase-based translation.
In experiments on Chinese-English and Arabic-
English translation, we find that when both source
and target syntax are made available to the model
in an unobtrusive way, the model chooses to build
structures that are more syntactically well-formed
and yield significantly better translations than a
nonsyntactic hierarchical phrase-based model.

ment in the sense that at least one word in f is
aligned to a word in e, and no word in f is aligned
to a word outside of e, or vice versa. Then the ex-
tracted grammar is the smallest STSG G satisfying:
If (, ) is a pair of subtrees of a training ex-

If (2, 2) G, (3, 3) G, and (1, 1) is

For example, consider the training example in Fig-

in Figure 1 can be extracted. The elementary tree
pairs (2, 2) and (3, 3) are rules in G because
their yields are phrase pairs, and (1, 1) results
from subtracting (2, 2) from (3, 3).

2.2 Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984496">
Exact tree-to-tree translation requires that transla-
tion rules deal with syntactic constituents on both
the source and target side, which reduces the num-
ber of eligible phrases. Table 1 shows an analy-
sis of phrases extracted from human word-aligned
and parsed data and automatically word-aligned
and parsed data.1 The first line shows the num-
ber of phrase-pair occurrences that are extracted
in the absence of syntactic constraints,2 and the
second line shows the maximum number of nested
phrase-pair occurrences, which is the most that ex-
act syntax-based extraction can achieve. Whereas
tree-to-string extraction and string-to-tree extrac-
tion permit 7080% of the maximum possible
number of phrase pairs, tree-to-tree extraction only
permits 6070%.
Why does this happen? We can see that moving
from human annotations to automatic annotations
decreases not only the absolute number of phrase
pairs, but the percentage of phrases that pass the
syntactic filters. Wellington et al. (2006), in a more
systematic study, find that, of sentences where the
tree-to-tree constraint blocks rule extraction, the
majority are due to parser errors. To address this
problem, Liu et al. (2009) extract rules from pairs

\x0cof packed forests instead of pairs of trees. Since a
packed forest is much more likely to include the
correct tree, it is less likely that parser errors will
cause good rules to be filtered out.
However, even on human-annotated data, tree-
to-tree extraction misses many rules, and many
such rules would seem to be useful. For ex-
ample, in Figure 2, the whole English phrase
Taiwans. . .shores is an NP, but its Chinese
counterpart is not a constituent. Furthermore, nei-
ther surplus. . .shores nor its Chinese counterpart
are constituents. But both rules are arguably use-
ful for translation. Wellington et al. therefore ar-
gue that in order to extract as many rules as possi-
ble, a more powerful formalism than synchronous
CFG/TSG is required: for example, generalized
multitext grammar (Melamed et al., 2004), which
is equivalent to synchronous set-local multicom-
ponent CFG/TSG (Weir, 1988).
But the problem illustrated in Figure 2 does
not reflect a very deep fact about syntax or cross-
lingual divergences, but rather choices in annota-
tion style that interact badly with the exact tree-
to-tree extraction heuristic. On the Chinese side,
the IP is too flat (because /Taiwan has been
analyzed as a topic), whereas the more articulated
structure
(1) [NP Taiwan [NP [PP zai . . .] shuncha]]
would also be quite reasonable. On the English
side, the high attachment of the PP disagrees with
the corresponding Chinese structure, but low at-
tachment also seems reasonable:
(2) [NP [NP Taiwans] [NP surplus in trade. . .]]
Thus even in the gold-standard parse trees, phrase
structure can be underspecified (like the flat IP
above) or uncertain (like the PP attachment above).
For this reason, some approaches work with a
more flexible notion of constituency. Synchronous
tree-sequencesubstitution grammar (STSSG) al-
lows either side of a rule to comprise a sequence of
trees instead of a single tree (Zhang et al., 2008). In
the substitution operation, a sequence of sister sub-
stitution nodes is rewritten with a tree sequence of
equal length (see Figure 3a). This extra flexibility
effectively makes the analysis (1) available to us.
Any STSSG can be converted into an equivalent
STSG via the creation of virtual nodes (see Fig-
ure 3b): for every elementary tree sequence with
roots X1, . . . , Xn, create a new root node with a

complex label X1 Xn immediately dominat-
ing the old roots, and replace every sequence of
substitution sites X1, . . . , Xn with a single substi-
tution site X1 Xn. This is essentially what
syntax-augmented MT (SAMT) does, in the string-
to-tree setting (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006). In
addition, SAMT drops the requirement that the Xi
are sisters, and uses categories X / Y (an X missing
a Y on the right) and Y \\ X (an X missing a Y on the
left) in the style of categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel,
1953). Under this flexible notion of constituency,
both (1) and (2) become available, albeit with more
complicated categories.
Both STSSG and SAMT are examples of what
we might call fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction. We fol-
low this approach here as well: as in STSSG, we
work on tree-to-tree data, and we use the com-
plex categories of SAMT. Moreover, we allow the
product categories X1 Xn to be of any length
n, and we allow the slash categories to take any
number of arguments on either side. Thus every
phrase can be assigned a (possibly very complex)
syntactic category, so that fuzzy tree-to-tree ex-
traction does not lose any rules relative to string-
to-string extraction.
On the other hand, if several rules are extracted

most-frequent rule is kept, and its count is the to-
tal count of all the rules. This means that there is a

tracted by fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction and hierar-
chical string-to-string extraction.

Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction (like string-to-string

exact tree-to-tree extraction does. In Figure 2, we

Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction allows any of these
to be the source side of a rule. We might think of
it as effectively restructuring the trees by insert-
ing nodes with complex labels. However, it is not
possible to represent this restructuring with a sin-
gle tree (see Figure 4). More formally, let us say
that two phrases wi wj1 and wi wj1 nest
if i i
&amp;lt; j j or i
i &amp;lt; j &amp;lt; j; otherwise,
they cross. The two Chinese phrases (4) and (5)
cross, and therefore cannot both be constituents in
the same tree. In other words, exact tree-to-tree ex-
traction commits to a single structural analysis but
fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction pursues many restruc-
tured analyses at once.
We can strike a compromise by continuing to al-
low SAMT-style complex categories, but commit-
ting to a single analysis by requiring all phrases to
nest. To do this, we use a simple heuristic. Iterate
through all the phrase pairs ( f , e) in the following
order:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8920698">
1. sort by whether f and e can be assigned a sim-
ple syntactic category (both, then one, then
neither); if there is a tie,
2. sort by how many syntactic constituents f and
e cross (low to high); if there is a tie,
3. give priority to ( f , e) if neither f nor e be-
gins or ends with punctuation; if there is a tie,
finally
4. sort by the position of f in the source-side
string (right to left).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986093125">
For each phrase pair, accept it if it does not cross
any previously accepted phrase pair; otherwise, re-
ject it.
Because this heuristic produces a set of nesting
phrases, we can represent them all in a single re-
structured tree. In Figure 4, this heuristic chooses
structure (a) because the English-side counterpart
of IP/VP has the simple category NP.

3 Decoding
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998112230769231">
In decoding, the rules extracted during training
must be reassembled to form a derivation whose
source side matches the input sentence. In the ex-
act tree-to-tree approach, whenever substitution
is performed, the root labels of the substituted
trees must match the labels of the substitution
nodescall this the matching constraint. Because
this constraint must be satisfied on both the source
and target side, it can become difficult to general-
ize well from training examples to new input sen-
tences.
Venugopal et al. (2009), in the string-to-tree set-
ting, attempt to soften the data-fragmentation ef-
fect of the matching constraint: instead of trying
to find the single derivation with the highest prob-
ability, they sum over derivations that differ only
in their nonterminal labels and try to find the sin-
gle derivation-class with the highest probability.
Still, only derivations that satisfy the matching
constraint are included in the summation.
But in some cases we may want to soften the
matching constraint itself. Some syntactic cate-
gories are similar enough to be considered com-
patible: for example, if a rule rooted in VBD (past-
tense verb) could substitute into a site labeled VBZ
(present-tense verb), it might still generate correct
output. This is all the more true with the addition
of SAMT-style categories: for example, if a rule
rooted in ADVP VP could substitute into a site
labeled VP, it would very likely generate correct
output.
Since we want syntactic information to help the
model make good translation choices, not to rule
out potentially correct choices, we can change the
way the information is used during decoding: we
allow any rule to substitute into any site, but let
the model learn which substitutions are better than
others. To do this, we add the following features to
the model:

<bodyText confidence="0.999371833333334">
The sizes of the parallel texts used are shown in Ta-
ble 2. We word-aligned the Chinese-English par-
allel text using GIZA++ followed by link dele-
tion (Fossum et al., 2008), and the Arabic-English
parallel text using a combination of GIZA++ and
LEAF (Fraser and Marcu, 2007). We parsed the
source sides of both parallel texts using the Berke-
ley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), trained on the Chi-
nese Treebank 6 and Arabic Treebank parts 13,
and the English sides using a reimplementation of
the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).
For string-to-string extraction, we used the same
constraints as in previous work (Chiang, 2007),
with differences shown in Table 2. Rules with non-
terminals were extracted from a subset of the data
(labeled Core in Table 2), and rules without non-
terminals were extracted from the full parallel text.
Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction was performed using
analogous constraints. For exact tree-to-tree ex-
traction, we used simpler settings: no limit on ini-
tial phrase size or unaligned words, and a maxi-
mum of 7 frontier nodes on the source side.
All systems used the glue rule (Chiang, 2005),
which allows the decoder, working bottom-up, to
stop building hierarchical structure and instead
concatenate partial translations without any re-
ordering. The model attaches a weight to the glue
rule so that it can learn from data whether to build
shallow or rich structures, but for efficiencys sake
the decoder has a hard limit, called the distortion

limit, above which the glue rule must be used.
We trained two 5-gram language models: one
on the combined English halves of the bitexts, and
one on two billion words of English. These were
smoothed using modified Kneser-Ney (Chen and
Goodman, 1998) and stored using randomized data
structures similar to those of Talbot and Brants
(2008).
The base feature set for all systems was similar
to the expanded set recently used for Hiero (Chiang
et al., 2009), but with bigram features (source and
target word) instead of trigram features (source and
target word and neighboring source word). For all
systems but the baselines, the features described
in Section 3 were added. The systems were trained
using MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Chiang
et al., 2009) on a tuning set of about 3000 sentences
of newswire from NIST MT evaluation data and
GALE development data, disjoint from the train-
ing data. We optimized feature weights on 90% of
this and held out the other 10% to determine when
to stop.

4.2 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.998953">
Table 3 shows the scores on our development sets
and test sets, which are about 3000 and 2000
sentences, respectively, of newswire drawn from
NIST MT evaluation data and GALE development
data and disjoint from the tuning data.
For Chinese, we first tried increasing the distor-
tion limit from 10 words to 20. This limit controls
how deeply nested the tree structures built by the
decoder are, and we want to see whether adding
syntactic information leads to more complex struc-
tures. This change by itself led to an increase in
the BLEU score. We then compared against two
systems using tree-to-tree grammars. Using ex-
act tree-to-tree extraction, we got a much smaller
grammar, but decreased accuracy on all but the
Chinese-English test set, where there was no sig-
nificant change. But with fuzzy tree-to-tree extrac-
tion, we obtained an improvement of +0.6 on both
Chinese-English sets, and +0.7/+0.8 on theArabic-
English sets.
Applying the heuristic for nesting phrases re-
duced the grammar sizes dramatically (by a factor
of 2.4 for Chinese and 4.2 for Arabic) but, interest-
ingly, had almost no effect on translation quality: a
slight decrease in BLEU on the Arabic-English de-
velopment set and no significant difference on the
other sets. This suggests that the strength of fuzzy
tree-to-tree extraction lies in its ability to break up
flat structures and to reconcile the source and target
trees with each other, rather than multiple restruc-
turings of the training trees.

4.3 Rule usage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998630285714286">
We then took a closer look at the behavior of
the string-to-string and fuzzy tree-to-tree gram-
mars (without the nesting heuristic). Because the
rules of these grammars are in one-to-one corre-
spondence, we can analyze the string-to-string sys-
tems derivations as though they had syntactic cat-
egories. First, Table 4 shows that the system using
the tree-to-tree grammar used the glue rule much
less and performed more matching substitutions.
That is, in order to minimize errors on the tuning
set, the model learned to build syntactically richer
and more well-formed derivations.
Tables 5 and 6 show how the new syntax fea-
tures affected particular substitutions. In general
we see a shift towards more matching substitu-
tions; correct placement of punctuation is particu-
larly emphasized. Several changes appear to have
to do with definiteness of NPs: on the English
side, adding the syntax features encourages match-
ing substitutions of type DT \\ NP-C (anarthrous
NP), but discourages DT \\ NP-C and NN from
substituting into NP-C and vice versa. For ex-
ample, a translation with the rewriting NP-C
DT \\ NP-C begins with 24th meeting of the
Standing Committee. . ., but the system using the
fuzzy tree-to-tree grammar changes this to The
24th meeting of the Standing Committee. . . .

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998305692307692">
Though exact tree-to-tree translation tends to ham-
per translation quality by imposing too many con-
straints during both grammar extraction and de-
coding, we have shown that using both source and
target syntax improves translation accuracy when
the model is given the opportunity to learn from
data how strongly to apply syntactic constraints.
Indeed, we have found that the model learns on its
own to choose syntactically richer and more well-
formed structures, demonstrating that source- and
target-side syntax can be used together profitably
as long as they are not allowed to overconstrain the
translation model.

<abstract confidence="0.998793380952381">Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a simple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</abstract>

This is essentially what syntax-augmented MT (SAMT) does, in the stringto-tree setting (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006). In addition, SAMT drops the requirement that the Xi are sisters, and uses categories X / Y (an X missing a Y on the right) and Y \\ X (an X missing a Y on the left) in the style of categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953). Under this flexible notion of constituency, both (1) and (2) become available, albeit with more complicated categories. Both STSSG and SAMT are examples of what we might call fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction. We follow this approach here as well: as in STSSG, we work on tree-to-tree data, and we use the complex categories of SAMT. Moreover, we allow the product categories X1 Xn to be of any length n, and we allow the slash categories to take any number of arguments on either side. Thus every phrase can be assigned a (possibly very complex) syntactic category, so that fuzzy tree-to-tree extracti</context>

We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a simple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy. 1 Introduction Statistical translation models that use synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) or related formalisms to try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006). The next obvious step is toward models that make full use of syntactic information on both sides. But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrasebased models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and Lavie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009). In thi</context>

One confounding factor in such a comparison is that some methods generate many new syntactic categories, making it more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at decoding time. We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrasebased model Hiero (Chiang, 2005). This augmented model is able to learn from data whether to rely on syntax or not, or to revert back to monotone phrase-based translation. In experiments on Chinese-English and ArabicEnglish translation, we find that when both source and target syntax are made available to the model in an unobtrusive way, the model chooses to build structures that are more syntactically well-formed and yield significantly better translations than a nonsyntactic hierarchical phrase-based model. 2 Grammar extraction A synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) is a set of rules or elementary tree pairs (, ), </context>

Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction was performed using analogous constraints. For exact tree-to-tree extraction, we used simpler settings: no limit on initial phrase size or unaligned words, and a maximum of 7 frontier nodes on the source side. All systems used the glue rule (Chiang, 2005), which allows the decoder, working bottom-up, to stop building hierarchical structure and instead concatenate partial translations without any reordering. The model attaches a weight to the glue rule so that it can learn from data whether to build shallow or rich structures, but for efficiencys sake the decoder has a hard limit, called the distortion 1448 \x0cChi-Eng Ara-Eng Core training words 32+38M 28+34M initial phrase size 10 15 final rule size 6 6 nonterminals 2 2 loose source 0 loose target 0 2 Full training words 240+260M 190+220M final rule size 6 6 nonterminals 0 0 loose source loos</context>

However, even on human-annotated data, treeto-tree extraction misses many rules, and many such rules would seem to be useful. For example, in Figure 2, the whole English phrase Taiwans. . .shores is an NP, but its Chinese counterpart is not a constituent. Furthermore, neither surplus. . .shores nor its Chinese counterpart are constituents. But both rules are arguably useful for translation. Wellington et al. therefore argue that in order to extract as many rules as possible, a more powerful formalism than synchronous CFG/TSG is required: for example, generalized multitext grammar (Melamed et al., 2004), which is equivalent to synchronous set-local multicomponent CFG/TSG (Weir, 1988). But the problem illustrated in Figure 2 does not reflect a very deep fact about syntax or crosslingual divergences, but rather choices in annotation style that interact badly with the exact treeto-tree extraction heuristic. On the Chinese side, the IP is too flat (because /Taiwan has been analyzed as a topic), whereas the more articulated structure (1) [NP Taiwan [NP [PP zai . . .] shuncha]] would also be quite reasonable.

We word-aligned the Chinese-English parallel text using GIZA++ followed by link deletion (Fossum et al., 2008), and the Arabic-English parallel text using a combination of GIZA++ and LEAF (Fraser and Marcu, 2007). We parsed the source sides of both parallel texts using the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), trained on the Chinese Treebank 6 and Arabic Treebank parts 13, and the English sides using a reimplementation of the Collins parser (Collins, 1997). For string-to-string extraction, we used the same constraints as in previous work (Chiang, 2007), with differences shown in Table 2. Rules with nonterminals were extracted from a subset of the data (labeled Core in Table 2), and rules without nonterminals were extracted from the full parallel text. Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction was performed using analogous constraints. For exact tree-to-tree extraction, we used simpler settings: no limit on in</context>

In the exact tree-to-tree approach, whenever substitution is performed, the root labels of the substituted trees must match the labels of the substitution nodescall this the matching constraint. Because this constraint must be satisfied on both the source and target side, it can become difficult to generalize well from training examples to new input sentences. Venugopal et al. (2009), in the string-to-tree setting, attempt to soften the data-fragmentation effect of the matching constraint: instead of trying to find the single derivation with the highest probability, they sum over derivations that differ only in their nonterminal labels and try to find the single derivation-class with the highest probability. Still, only derivations that satisfy the matching constraint are included in the summation. But in some cases we may want to soften the matching constraint itself.

For this reason, some approaches work with a more flexible notion of constituency. Synchronous tree-sequencesubstitution grammar (STSSG) allows either side of a rule to comprise a sequence of trees instead of a single tree (Zhang et al., 2008). In the substitution operation, a sequence of sister substitution nodes is rewritten with a tree sequence of equal length (see Figure 3a). This extra flexibility effectively makes the analysis (1) available to us. Any STSSG can be converted into an equivalent STSG via the creation of virtual nodes (see Figure 3b): for every elementary tree sequence with roots X1, . . . , Xn, create a new root node with a . . . .

But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrasebased models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and Lavie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009). In this paper, we explore the reasons why treeto-tree translation has been challenging, and how source syntax and target syntax might be used together. Drawing on previous successful attempts to relax syntactic constraints during grammar extraction in various ways (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), we compare several methods for extracting a synchronous grammar from tree-to-tree data. One confounding factor in such a comparison is that some methods generate many new syntactic categories, making it more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at decoding time. We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrasebased model Hiero (Chiang, 2005). This augmented model is able to learn from data whether to rely on syntax or not, or to revert back to monotone phrase-based translation. In experiments on Chinese</context>

This is essentially what syntax-augmented MT (SAMT) does, in the stringto-tree setting (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006). In addition, SAMT drops the requirement that the Xi are sisters, and uses categories X / Y (an X missing a Y on the right) and Y \\ X (an X missing a Y on the left) in the style of categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953). Under this flexible notion of constituency, both (1) and (2) become available, albeit with more complicated categories. Both STSSG and SAMT are examples of what we might call fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction. We follow this approach here as well: as in STSSG, we work on tree-to-tree data, and we use the complex categories of SAMT. Moreover, we allow the product categories X1 Xn </context>
