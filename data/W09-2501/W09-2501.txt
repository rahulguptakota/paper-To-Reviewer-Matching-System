Abstract
Multi-word expressions (MWE) have seen much at-
tention from the NLP community. In this paper, we
investigate their impact on the recognition of tex-
tual entailment (RTE). Using the manual Microsoft
Research annotations, we first manually count and
classify MWEs in RTE data. We find few, most
of which are arguably unlikely to cause processing
problems. We then consider the impact of MWEs on
a current RTE system. We are unable to confirm that
entailment recognition suffers from wrongly aligned
MWEs. In addition, MWE alignment is difficult
to improve, since MWEs are poorly represented in
state-of-the-art paraphrase resources, the only avail-
able sources for multi-word similarities. We con-
clude that RTE should concentrate on other phe-
nomena impacting entailment, and that paraphrase
knowledge is best understood as capturing general
lexico-syntactic variation.
1 Introduction
Multi-word expressions (MWEs) can be defined as
“idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word bound-
aries”, such as traffic light or kick the bucket. Called
a “pain in the neck for NLP”, they have received
considerable attention in recent years and it has
been suggested that proper treatment could make
a significant difference in various NLP tasks (Sag
et al., 2002). The importance attributed to them is
also reflected in a number of workshops (Bond et
al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2004; Moirón et al., 2006;
Grégoire et al., 2007). However, there are few de-
tailed breakdowns of the benefits that improved
MWE handling provides to applications.
This paper investigates the impact of MWEs
on the “recognition of textual entailment” (RTE)
task (Dagan et al., 2006). Our analysis ties in with
the pivotal question of what types of knowledge
are beneficial for RTE. A number of papers have
suggested that paraphrase knowledge plays a very
important role (Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Marsi et al.,
2007; Dinu and Wang, 2009). For example, Bar-
Haim et al. (2005) conclude: “Our analysis also
shows that paraphrases stand out as a dominant
contributor to the entailment task.”
The term “paraphrase” is however often con-
strued broadly. In Bar-Haim et al. (2005), it refers
to the ability of relating lexico-syntactic reformula-
tions such as diathesis alternations, passivizations,
or symmetrical predicates (X lent his BMW to Y/Y
borrowed X’s BMW). If “paraphrase” simply refers
to the use of a language’s lexical and syntactic
possibilities to express equivalent meaning in dif-
ferent ways, then paraphrases are certainly impor-
tant to RTE. But such a claim means little more
than that RTE can profit from good understand-
ing of syntax and semantics. However, given the
abovementioned interest in MWEs, there is another
possibility: does success in RTE involve proper
handling of MWEs, such as knowing that take a
pass on is equivalent to aren’t purchasing, or kicked
the bucket to died? This seems not too far-fetched:
Knowledge about MWEs is under-represented in
existing semantic resources like WordNet or dis-
tributional thesauri, but should be present in para-
phrase resources, which provide similarity judg-
ments between phrase pairs, including MWEs.
The goal of our study is to investigate the merits
of this second, more precise, hypothesis, measur-
ing the impact of MWE processing on RTE. In
the absence of a universally accepted definition
of MWEs, we define MWEs in the RTE setting
as multi-word alignments, i.e., words that partici-
pate in more than one word alignment link between
premise and hypothesis:
(1)
PRE: He died.
HYP: He kicked the bucket.
The exclusion of MWEs that do not lead to multi-
word alignments (i.e., which can be aligned word
by word) is not a significant loss, since these cases
are unlikely to cause significant problems for RTE.
In addition, an alignment-based approach has the
advantage of generality: Almost all existing RTE
models align the linguistic material of the premise
1
and hypothesis and base at least part of their de-
cision on properties of this alignment (Burchardt
et al., 2007; Hickl and Bensley, 2007; Iftene and
Balahur-Dobrescu, 2007; Zanzotto et al., 2007).
We proceed in three steps. First, we analyze
the Microsoft Research (MSR) manual word align-
ments (Brockett, 2007) for the RTE2 dataset (Bar-
Haim et al., 2006), shedding light on the rela-
tionship between alignments and multi-word ex-
pressions. We provide frequency estimates and
a coarse-grained classification scheme for multi-
word expressions on textual entailment data. Next,
we analyze two widely used types of paraphrase
resources with respect to their modeling of MWEs.
Finally, we investigate the impact of MWEs and
their handling on practical entailment recognition.
2 Multi-Word Expressions in Alignment
Almost all textual entailment recognition models
incorporate an alignment procedure that establishes
correspondences between the premise and the hy-
pothesis. The computation of word alignments
is usually phrased as an optimization task. The
search space is based on lexical similarities, but
usually extended with structural biases in order to
obtain alignments with desirable properties, such
as the contiguous alignment of adjacent words, or
the mapping of different source words on to differ-
ent target words. One prominent constraint of the
IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993)
is functional alignment, that is each target word
is mapped onto at most one source word. Other
models produce only one-to-one alignments, where
both alignment directions must be functional.
MWEs that involve many-to-many or one-to-
many alignments like Ex. (1) present a problem
for such constrained word alignment models. A
functional alignment model can still handle cases
like Ex. (1) correctly in one direction (from bottom
to top), but not in the other one. One-to-one align-
ments manage neither. Various workarounds have
been proposed in the MT literature, such as comput-
ing word alignments in both directions and forming
the union or intersection. Even if an alignment is
technically within the search space, accurate knowl-
edge about plausible phrasal matches is necessary
for it to be assigned a high score and thus identified.
3 MWEs in the RTE2 Dataset
In the first part of our study, we estimate the extent
to which the inability of aligners to model one-to-
CARDINALITY

DECOM- yes (1) (3)
POSABLE? no (2) (4)
OTHER (5), (6), (7)

(M-to-M: many-to-many; 1-to-M: one-to-many).
many and many-to-many correspondences is an
issue. To do so, we use the Microsoft Research
manual alignments for the RTE2 data. To date, the
MSR data constitutes the only gold standard align-
ment corpus publicly available. Since annotators
were not constrained to use one-to-one alignments,
we assume that the MSR alignments contain multi-
word alignments where appropriate.
From the MSR data, we extract all multi-word
alignments that fall outside the scope of “func-
tional” alignments, i.e., alignments of the form
“many-to-many” or “one-to-many” (in the direction
hypothesis-premise). We annotate them according
to the categories defined below. The MSR data
distinguishes between SURE and POSSIBLE align-
ments. We only take the SURE alignments into
account. While this might mean missing some
multi-word alignments, we found many “possible”
links to be motivated by the desire to obtain a high-
coverage alignment, as Ex. 2 shows:
(2)
PRE: ECB spokeswoman, Regina Schueller, ...
HYP: Regina Schueller ...
Here, the hypothesis words “Regina Schueller” are
individually “sure”-aligned to the premise words
“Regina Schueller” (solid lines), but are also both
“possible”-linked to “ECB spokeswoman” (dashed
lines). This “possible” alignment can be motivated
on syntactic or referential grounds, but does not
indicate a correspondence in meaning (as opposed
to reference).
3.1 Analysis of Multi-Word Expressions
Table 1 shows the seven categories we define to
distinguish the different types of multi-word align-
ments. We use two main complementary criteria
for our annotation. The first one is the cardinality
of the alignment: does it involve phrases proper
on both sides (many-to-many), or just on one side
(one-to-many)? The second one is decomposabil-
ity: is it possible to create one or more one-to-one
alignments that capture the main semantic contribu-
tion of the multi-word alignment? Our motivation
2
for introducing this criterion is that even aligners
that are unable to recover the complete MWE have
a chance to identify the links crucial for entailment
if the MWE is decomposable (categories (1) and
(3)). This is not possible for the more difficult
non-decomposable categories (2) and (4). The re-
maining categories, (5) to (7), involve auxiliaries,
multiple mentions, and named entities, which are
not MWEs in the narrow sense. We will henceforth
use the term “true MWEs” to refer to categories
(1)–(4), as opposed to (5)–(7).
The criteria we use for MWE categorization are
different from the ones adopted by Sag et al. (2002).
Sag et al.’s goal is to classify constructions by their
range of admissible variation, and thus relies heav-
ily on syntactic variability. Since we are more inter-
ested in semantic properties, we base our classes on
alignment patterns, complemented by semantic de-
composability judgments (which reflect the severity
of treating MWEs like compositional phrases). As
mentioned in Section 1, our method misses MWEs
aligned with one-to-one links; however, the use of
a one-to-one link by the annotation can be seen as
evidence for decomposability.
A. Multiple words on both sides
(1) Compositional phrases (CP):
Each word in the left phrase can be aligned to one
word in the right phrase, e.g., capital punishment
→ death penalty for which capital can be aligned
to death and punishment to penalty.
(2) Non-compositional phrases (NCP):
There is no simple way to align words between the
two phrases, such as in poorly represented → very
few or illegally entered → broke into.
B. One word to multiple words
(3) Headed multi-word expressions (MWEH):
A single word can be aligned with one token of
an MWE: e.g., vote → cast ballots where ballots
carries enough of the semantics of vote.
(4) Non-headed MWEs (MWENH):
The MWE as a whole is necessary to capture the
meaning of the single word, which doesn’t align
well to any individual word of the MWE: e.g., ferry
→ passenger vessel.
(5) Multiple mentions (MENTION):
These alignments link one word to multiple occur-
rences of the same or related word(s) in the text,
e.g., military → forces ... Marines, antibiotics →

antibiotics ... drug.
(6) Parts of named entities (PART):
Each element of a named entity is aligned to the
whole named entity: e.g., Shukla → Nidhi Shukla.
This includes the use of acronyms or abbreviations
on one side and their spelled-out forms on the other
side, such as U.S. → United States.
(7) Auxiliaries (AUX):
The last category involves the presence of an auxil-
iary: e.g., were → are being.
Initially, one of the authors used these categories
to analyze the complete RTE2 MSR data (dev and
test sets). The most difficult distinction to draw
was, not surprisingly, the decision between decom-
posable multi-word alignments (categories (1) and
(3)) and non-decomposable ones (categories (2)
and (4)). To ascertain that a reliable distinction
can be made, another author did an independent
second analysis of the instances from categories
(1) through (4). We found moderate inter-annotator
agreement (κ = 0.60), indicating that not all, but
most annotation decisions are uncontroversial.
3.2 Distribution of Multi-Word Expressions
Table 2 shows the distribution in the MSR data
of all alignment categories. Our evaluation will
concentrate on the “true MWE” categories (1) to
(4): CP, NCP, MWEH and MWENH.1
1
The OTHER categories (5) to (7) can generally be dealt
with during pre- or post-processing: Auxiliary-verb combi-
nations (cat. 7) are usually “headed” so that it is sufficient to
align the main verb; multiple occurrences of words referring
to the same entity (cat. 5) is an anaphor resolution problem;
and named-entity matches (cat. 6) are best solved by using a
named entity recognizer to collapse NEs into a single token.
3
In RTE2 dev and test, we find only 81 and 60
true MWEs, respectively. Out of the 1600 sentence
pairs in the two datasets, 8.2% involve true MWEs
(73 in RTE2 dev and 58 in RTE2 test). On the level
of word alignments, the ratio is even smaller: only
1.2% of all SURE alignments involve true MWEs.
Furthermore, more than half of them are decom-
posable (MWEH/CP). Some examples from this
category are (“heads” marked in boldface):
sue→ file lawsuits against
diseases → liver cancer
Barbie → Barbie doll
got → was awarded with
works → executive director
military → naval forces
In particular when light verbs are involved (file
lawsuits) or when modification adds just minor
meaning aspects (executive director), we argue that
it is sufficient to align the left-hand expression to
the “head” in order to decide entailment.
Consider, in contrast, these examples from the
non-decomposable categories (MWENH/NCP):
politician → presidential candidate
killed → lost their lives
shipwreck → sunken ship
ever → in its history
widow → late husband
sexes → men and women
These cases span a broad range of linguistic rela-
tions from pure associations (widow/late husband)
to collective expressions (sexes/men and women).
Arguably, in these cases aligning the left-hand word
to any single word on the right can seriously throw
off an entailment recognition system. However,
they are fairly rare, occurring only in 65 out of
1600 sentences.
3.3 Conclusions from the MSR Analysis
Our analysis has found that 8% of the sentences
in the MSR dataset involve true MWEs. At the
word level, the fraction of true MWEs of all SURE
alignment links is just over 1%.
Of course, if errors in the alignment of these
MWEs had a high probability to lead to entailment
recognition errors, MWEs would still constitute a
major factor in determining entailment. However,
we have argued that about half of the true MWEs
are decomposable, that is, the part of the alignment
that is crucial for entailment can be recovered with
a one-to-one alignment link that can be identified
even by very limited alignment models.
This leaves considerably less than 1% of all word
alignments (or ∼4% of sentence pairs) where im-
perfect MWE alignments are able at all to exert a
negative influence on entailment. However, this is
just an upper bound – their impact is by no means
guaranteed. Thus, our conclusion from the annota-
tion study is that we do not expect MWEs to play a
large role in actual entailment recognition.
4 MWEs in Paraphrase Resources
Before we come to actual experiments on the au-
tomatic recognition of MWEs in a practical RTE
system, we need to consider the prerequisites for
this task. As mentioned in Section 2, if an RTE
system is to establish multi-word alignments, it re-
quires a knowledge source that provides accurate
semantic similarity judgments for “many-to-many”
alignments (capital punishment – death penalty)
as well as for “one-to-many” alignments (vote –
cast ballots). Such similarities are not present in
standard lexical resources like WordNet or Dekang
Lin’s thesaurus (Lin, 1998).
The best class of candidate resources to provide
wide-coverage of multi-word similarities seems to
be paraphrase resources. In this section, we ex-
amine to what extent two of the most widely used
paraphrase resource types provide supporting ev-
idence for the true MWEs in the MSR data. We
deliberately use corpus-derived, noisy resources,
since we are interested in the real-world (rather
than idealized) prospects for accurate MWE align-
ment.
Dependency-based paraphrases. Lin and Pan-
tel (2002)’s DIRT model collects lexicalized de-
pendency paths with two slots at either end. Paths
with similar distributions over slot fillers count as
paraphrases, with the quality measured by a mutual
information-based similarity over the slot fillers.
The outcome of their study is the DIRT database
which lists paraphrases for around 230,000 depen-
dency paths, extracted from about 1 GB of mis-
cellaneous newswire text. We converted the DIRT
paraphrases2 into a resource of semantic similari-
ties between raw text phrases. We used a heuristic
mapping from dependency relations to word or-
der, and obtained similarity ratings by rescaling the
DIRT paraphrase ratings, which are based on a mu-
tual information-based measure of filler similarity,
onto the range [0,1].

Parallel corpora-based paraphrases. An alter-
native approach to paraphrase acquisition was pro-
posed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005). It
exploits the variance inherent in translation to ex-
tract paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora.
Concretely, it observes translational relationships
between a source and a target language and pairs
up source language phrases with other source lan-
guage phrases that translate into the same target
language phrases. We applied this method to
the large Chinese-English GALE MT evaluation
P3/P3.5 corpus (∼2 GB text per language, mostly
newswire). The large number of translations makes
it impractical to store all observed paraphrases. We
therefore filtered the list of paraphrases against the
raw text of the RTE corpora, acquiring the 10 best
paraphrases for around 100,000 two- and three-
word phrases. The MLE conditional probabilities
were scaled onto [0,1] for each target.
Analysis. We checked the two resources for the
presence of the true MWEs identified in the MSR
data. We found that overall 34% of the MWEs ap-
pear in these resources, with more decomposable
MWEs (MWEH/CP) than non-decomposable ones
(MWENH/NCP) (42.1% vs. 24.6%). However, we
find that almost all of the MWEs that are covered
by the paraphrase resources are assigned very low
scores, while erroneous paraphrases (expressions
with clearly different meanings) have higher scores.
This is illustrated in Table 3 for the case of poorly
represented, which is aligned to very few in one
RTE2 sentence. This paraphrase is on the list, but
with a lower similarity than unsuitable paraphrases
such as representatives or good. This problem is
widespread. Other examples of low-scoring para-
phrases are: another step → measures, quarantine
→ in isolation, punitive measures → sanctions,
held a position → served as, or inability → could
not.
The noise in the rankings means that any align-
ment algorithm faces a dilemma: either it uses a
high threshold and misses valid MWE alignments,
or it lowers its threshold and risks constructing
incorrect alignments.
5 Impact of MWEs on Practical
Entailment Recognition
This section provides the final step in our study: an
evaluation of the impact of MWEs on entailment
recognition in a current RTE system, and of the
benefits of explicit MWE alignment. While the

results of this experiment are not guaranteed to
transfer to other RTE system architectures, or to
future, improved paraphrase resources, it provides
a current snapshot of the practical impact of MWE
handling.
5.1 The Stanford RTE System
We base our experiments on the Stanford RTE sys-
tem which uses a staged architecture (MacCartney
et al., 2006). After the linguistic analysis which
produces dependency graphs for premise and hy-
pothesis, the alignment stage creates links between
the nodes of the two dependency trees. In the infer-
ence stage, the system produces roughly 70 features
for the aligned premise-hypothesis pair, almost all
of which are implementations of “small linguistic
theories” whose activation indicates lexical, syn-
tactic and semantic matches and mismatches of
different types. The entailment decision is com-
puted using a logistic regression on these features.
The Stanford system supports the use of dif-
ferent aligners without touching the rest of the
pipeline. We compare two aligners: a one-to-one
aligner, which cannot construct MWE alignments
(UNIQ), and a many-to-many aligner (MANLI)
(MacCartney et al., 2008), which can. Both align-
ers use around 10 large-coverage lexical resources
of semantic similarities, both manually compiled
resources (such as WordNet and NomBank) and
automatically induced resources (such as Dekang
Lin’s distributional thesaurus or InfoMap).
UNIQ: A one-to-one aligner. UNIQ constructs
an alignment between dependency graphs as the
highest-scoring mapping from each word in the
hypothesis to one word in the premise, or to null.
Mappings are scored by summing the alignment
scores of all individual word pairs (provided by the
lexical resources), plus edge alignment scores that
5
use the syntactic structure of premise and hypoth-
esis to introduce a bias for syntactic parallelism.
The large number of possible alignments (expo-
nential in the number of hypothesis words) makes
exhaustive search intractable. Instead, UNIQ uses a
stochastic search based on Gibbs sampling, a well-
known Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (see
de Marneffe et al. (2007) for details).
Since it does not support many-to-many align-
ments, the UNIQ aligner cannot make use of the
multi-word information present in the paraphrase
resources. To be able to capture some common
MWEs, the Stanford RTE system was originally
designed with a facility to concatenate MWEs
present in WordNet into a single token (mostly
particle verbs and collocations, e.g., treat as or
foreign minister). However, we discovered that
WordNet collapsing always has a negative effect.
Inspection of the constructed alignments suggests
that the lexical resources that inform the alignment
process do not provide scores for most collapsed
tokens (such as wait for), and precision suffers.
MANLI: A phrase-to-phrase aligner. MANLI
aims at finding an optimal alignment between
phrases, defined as contiguous spans of one or mul-
tiple words. MANLI characterizes alignments as
edit scripts, sets of edits (substitutions, deletions,
and insertions) over phrases. The quality of an
edit script is the sum of the quality of the individ-
ual edit steps. Individual edits are scored using a
feature-based scoring function that takes edit type
and size into consideration.3 The score for substi-
tution edits also includes a lexical similarity score
similar to UNIQ, plus potential knowledge about
the semantic relatedness of multi-word phrases not
expressible in UNIQ. Substitution edits also use
contextual features, including a distortion score
and a matching-neighbors feature.4 Due to the
dependence between alignment and segmentation
decisions, MANLI uses a simulated annealing strat-
egy to traverse the resulting large search space.
Even though MANLI is our current best candi-
date at recovering MWE alignments, it currently
has an important architectural limitation: it works
on textual phrases rather than dependency tree frag-
ments, and therefore misses all MWEs that are not
contiguous (e.g., due to inserted articles or adver-

Positive weights for all operation types ensure that

bials). This accounts for roughly 9% of the MWEs
in RTE2 data. Other work on RTE has targeted
specifically this observation and has described para-
phrases on a dependency level (Marsi et al., 2007;
Dinu and Wang, 2009).
Setup. To set the parameters of the two models
(i.e., the weights for different lexical resources for
UNIQ, and the weights for the edit operation for
MANLI), we use the RTE2 development data. Test-
ing takes place on the RTE2 test and RTE4 datasets.
For MANLI, we performed this procedure twice,
with the paraphrase resources described in Sec-
tion 4 once deactivated and once activated. We
evaluated the output of the Stanford RTE system
both on the word alignment level, and on the entail-
ment decision level.
5.2 Evaluation of Alignment Accuracy
The results for evaluating the MANLI and UNIQ
alignments against the manual alignment links in
the MSR RTE2 test set are given in Table 4. We
present micro-averaged numbers, where each align-
ment link counts equally (i.e., longer problems have
a larger impact). The overall difference is not large,
but MANLI produces a slightly better alignment.
The ability of MANLI to construct many-to-
many alignments is reflected in a different position
on the precision/recall curve: the MANLI aligner
is less precise than UNIQ, but has a higher recall.
Examples for UNIQ and MANLI alignments are
shown in Figures 1 and 2. A comparison of the
alignments shows the pattern to be expected from
Table 4: MANLI has a higher recall, but contains
occasional questionable links, such as at President
→ President in Figure 1.
However, the many-to-many alignments that
MANLI produces do not correspond well to the
MWE alignments. The overall impact of the para-
phrase resources is very small, and their addition
actually hurts MANLI’s performance slightly. A
more detailed analysis revealed two contrary trends.
On the one hand, the paraphrase resources provide

beneficial information, maybe surprisingly, in the
form of broad distributional similarities for single
words that were not available from the standard lex-
ical resources (e.g., the alignment “the company’s
letter” → “the company’s certificate”).
On the other hand, MANLI captures not one of
the true MWEs identified in the MSR data. It only
finds two many-to-many alignments which belong
to the CP category: aimed criticism → has criti-
cised, European currency → euro currency. We
see this as the practical consequences of our ob-
servation from Section 4: The scores in current
paraphrase resources are too noisy to support accu-
rate MWE recognition (cf. Table 3).
5.3 Evaluation of Entailment Recognition
We finally evaluated the performance of the Stan-
ford system using UNIQ and MANLI alignments
on the entailment task. We consider two datasets:
RTE2 test, the alignment evaluation dataset, and
the most recent RTE4 dataset, where current num-
bers for the Stanford system are available from last
year’s Text Analysis Conference (TAC).
A reasonable conjecture would be that better
alignments translate into better entailment recog-
nition. However, as the results in Tables 5 and 6
show, this is not the case. Overall, UNIQ outper-
forms MANLI by several percent accuracy despite
MANLI’s better alignments. This “baseline” differ-
ence should not be overinterpreted, since it may be
setup-specific: the features computed in the infer-
ence stage of the Stanford system were developed
mainly with the UNIQ aligner in mind. A more sig-
nificant result is that the integration of paraphrase
knowledge in MANLI has no effect on RTE2 test,
and even decreases performance on RTE4.
The general picture that we observe is that
there is only a loose coupling between alignments
and the entailment decision: individual align-
ments seldom matter. This is shown, for exam-
ple, by the alignments in Figures 1 and 2. Even
though MANLI provides a better overall alignment,
UNIQ’s alignment is “good enough” for entailment
purposes. In Figure 1, the two words UNIQ leaves
unaligned are a preposition (at) and a light verb
(aimed), both of which are not critical to determine
whether or not the premise entails the hypothesis.
This interpretation is supported by another analy-
sis, where we tested whether entailments involving
at least one true MWE are more difficult to rec-
ognize. We computed the entailment accuracy for
all applicable RTE2 test pairs (7%, 58 sentences).
The accuracy on this subset is 62% for the MANLI
model without paraphrases, 64% for the MANLI
model with paraphrases, and 74% for UNIQ. The
differences from the numbers in Table 5 are not
significant due to the small size of the MWE sam-
ple, but we observe that the accuracy on the MWE
subset tends to be higher than on the whole set
(rather than lower). Futhermore, even though we fi-
nally see a small beneficial effect of paraphrases on
the MANLI aligner, the UNIQ aligner, which com-
pletely ignores MWEs, still performs substantially
better.
Our conclusion is that wrong entailment deci-
sions rarely hinge on wrongly aligned MWEs, at
least with a probabilistic architecture like the Stan-
ford system. Consequently, it suffices to recover
the most crucial alignment links to predict entail-
ment, and the benefits associated with the use of
a more restricted alignment formulation, like the
one-to-one alignment formulation of UNIQ, out-
weighs those of more powerful alignment models,
like MANLI’s phrasal alignments.
6 Conclusions
We have investigated the influence of multi-word
expressions on the task of recognizing textual en-
tailment. In contrast to the widely held view that
proper treatment of MWEs could bring about a sub-
stantial improvement in NLP tasks, we found that
the importance of MWEs in RTE is rather small.
Among the MWEs that we identified in the align-
ments, more than half can be captured by one-to-
one alignments, and should not pose problems for
entailment recognition.
Furthermore, we found that the remaining
MWEs are rather difficult to model faithfully. The
MSR MWEs are poorly represented in state-of-the-

art lexical resources, and when they are present,
scoring issues arise. Consequently, at least in
the Stanford system, the integration of paraphrase
knowledge to enable MWE recognition has made
almost no difference either in terms of alignment
accuracy nor in entailment accuracy. Furthermore,
it is not the case that entailment recognition accu-
racy is worse for sentences with “true” MWEs. In
sum, we find that even though capturing and repre-
senting MWEs is an interesting problem in itself,
MWEs do not seem to be such a pain in the neck –
at least not for textual entailment.
Our results may seem to contradict the results
of many previous RTE studies such as (Bar-Haim
et al., 2005) which found paraphrases to make an
important contribution. However, the beneficial ef-
fect of paraphrases found in these studies refers not
to an alignment task, but to the ability of relating
lexico-syntactic reformulations such as diathesis
alternations or symmetrical predicates (buy/sell).
In the Stanford system, this kind of knowledge
is already present in the features of the inference
stage. Our results should therefore rather be seen
as a clarification of the complementary nature of
the paraphrase and MWE issues.
In our opinion, there is much more potential
for improvement from better estimates of semantic
similarity. This is true for phrasal similarity, as our
negative results for multi-word paraphrases show,
but also on the single-word level. The 2% gain
in accuracy for the Stanford system here over the
reported TAC RTE4 results stems merely from ef-
forts to clean up and rescale the lexical resources
used by the system, and outweighs the effect of
MWEs. One possible direction of research is con-
ditioning semantic similarity on context: Most cur-
rent lexical resources characterize similarity at the
lemma level, but true similarities of word or phrase
pairs are strongly context-dependent: obtain and
be awarded are much better matches in the context
of a degree than in the context of data.
