Abstract
In this paper we apply conditional
random fields (CRFs) to the semantic
role labelling task. We define a random
field over the structure of each sentence’s
syntactic parse tree. For each node
of the tree, the model must predict a
semantic role label, which is interpreted
as the labelling for the corresponding
syntactic constituent. We show how
modelling the task as a tree labelling
problem allows for the use of efficient
CRF inference algorithms, while also
increasing generalisation performance
when compared to the equivalent
maximum entropy classifier. We have
participated in the CoNLL-2005 shared
task closed challenge with full syntactic
information.
1 Introduction
The semantic role labelling task (SRL) involves
identifying which groups of words act as arguments
to a given predicate. These arguments must
be labelled with their role with respect to the
predicate, indicating how the proposition should be
semantically interpreted.
We apply conditional random fields (CRFs) to
the task of SRL proposed by the CoNLL shared
task 2005 (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005). CRFs are
undirected graphical models which define a condi-
tional distribution over labellings given an obser-
vation (Lafferty et al., 2001). These models allow
for the use of very large sets of arbitrary, over-
lapping and non-independent features. CRFs have
been applied with impressive empirical results to the
tasks of named entity recognition (McCallum and
Li, 2003; Cohn et al., 2005), part-of-speech (PoS)
tagging (Lafferty et al., 2001), noun phrase chunk-
ing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and extraction of table
data (Pinto et al., 2003), among other tasks.
While CRFs have not been used to date for SRL,
their close cousin, the maximum entropy model has
been, with strong generalisation performance (Xue
and Palmer, 2004; Lim et al., 2004). Most CRF
implementations have been specialised to work with
chain structures, where the labels and observations
form a linear sequence. Framing SRL as a linear
tagging task is awkward, as there is no easy model
of adjacency between the candidate constituent
phrases.
Our approach simultaneously performs both con-
stituent selection and labelling, by defining an undi-
rected random field over the parse tree. This allows
the modelling of interactions between parent and
child constituents, and the prediction of an optimal
argument labelling for all constituents in one pass.
The parse tree forms an acyclic graph, meaning that
efficient exact inference in a CRF is possible using
belief propagation.
2 Data
The data used for this task was taken from the
Propbank corpus, which supplements the Penn
Treebank with semantic role annotation. Full details
of the data set are provided in Carreras and Màrquez
(2005).
2.1 Data Representation
From each training instance we derived a tree, using
the parse structure from the Collins parser. The
169
nodes in the trees were relabelled with a semantic
role label indicating how their corresponding syn-
tactic constituent relates to each predicate, as shown
in Figure 1. The role labels are shown as subscripts
in the figure, and both the syntactic categories and
the words at the leaves are shown for clarity only
– these were not included in the tree. Addition-
ally, the dashed lines show those edges which were
pruned, following Xue and Palmer (2004) – only
nodes which are siblings to a node on the path from
the verb to the root are included in the tree. Child
nodes of included prepositional phrase nodes are
also included. This reduces the size of the resultant
tree whilst only very occasionally excluding nodes
which should be labelled as an argument.
The tree nodes were labelled such that only argu-
ment constituents received the argument label while
all argument children were labelled as outside, O.
Where there were parse errors, such that no con-
stituent exactly covered the token span of an argu-
ment, the smaller subsumed constituents were all
given the argument label.
We experimented with two alternative labelling
strategies: labelling a constituent’s children with a
new ‘inside’ label, and labelling the children with
the parent’s argument label. In the figure, the IN and
NP children of the PP would be affected by these
changes, both receiving either the inside I label or
AM-LOC label under the respective strategies. The
inside strategy performed nearly identically to the
standard (outside) strategy, indicating that either the
model cannot reliably predict the inside argument,
or that knowing that the children of a given node are
inside an argument is not particularly useful in pre-
dicting its label. The second (duplication) strategy
performed extremely poorly. While this allowed the
internal argument nodes to influence their ancestor
towards a particular labelling, it also dramatically
increased the number of nodes given an argument
label. This lead to spurious over-prediction of argu-
ments.
The model is used for decoding by predicting the
maximum probability argument label assignment to
each of the unlabelled trees. When these predic-
tions were inconsistent, and one argument subsumed
another, the node closest to the root of the tree was
deemed to take precedence over its descendants.
3 Model
We define a CRF over the labelling y given the
observation tree x as:
p(y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp
X
c∈C
X
k
λkfk(c, yc, x)
where C is the set of cliques in the observation tree,
λk are the model’s parameters and fk(·) is the fea-
ture function which maps a clique labelling to a vec-
tor of scalar values. The function Z(·) is the nor-
malising function, which ensures that p is a valid
probability distribution. This can be restated as:
p(y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp



X
v∈C1
X
k
λkgk(v, yv, x)

X
u,v∈C2
X
j

where C1 are the vertices in the graph and C2 are
the maximal cliques in the graph, consisting of all
(parent, child) pairs. The feature function has been
split into g and h, each dealing with one and two
node cliques respectively.
Preliminary experimentation without any
pair-wise features (h), was used to mimic a
simple maximum entropy classifier. This model
performed considerably worse than the model
with the pair-wise features, indicating that the
added complexity of modelling the parent-child
interactions provides for more accurate modelling
of the data.
The log-likelihood of the training sample was
optimised using limited memory variable metric
(LMVM), a gradient based technique. This required
the repeated calculation of the log-likelihood and
its derivative, which in turn required the use of
dynamic programming to calculate the marginal
probability of each possible labelling of every clique
using the sum-product algorithm (Pearl, 1988).
4 Features
As the conditional random field is conditioned on
the observation, it allows feature functions to be
defined over any part of the observation. The tree
structure requires that features incorporate either a
node labelling or the labelling of a parent and its

child. We have defined node and pairwise clique fea-
tures using data local to the corresponding syntactic
node(s), as well as some features on the predicate
itself.
Each feature type has been made into binary fea-
ture functions g and h by combining (feature type,
value) pairs with a label, or label pair, where this
combination was seen at least once in the training
data. The following feature types were employed,
most of which were inspired by previous works:
Basic features: {Head word, head PoS, phrase
syntactic category, phrase path, position rel-
ative to the predicate, surface distance to the
predicate, predicate lemma, predicate token,
predicate voice, predicate sub-categorisation,
syntactic frame}. These features are common
to many SRL systems and are described in Xue
and Palmer (2004).
Context features {Head word of first NP in prepo-
sition phrase, left and right sibling head words
and syntactic categories, first and last word
in phrase yield and their PoS, parent syntactic
category and head word}. These features are
described in Pradhan et al. (2005).
Common ancestor of the verb The syntactic cate-
gory of the deepest shared ancestor of both the
verb and node.
Feature conjunctions The following features were
conjoined: { predicate lemma + syntactic cate-
gory, predicate lemma + relative position, syn-
tactic category + first word of the phrase}.
Default feature This feature is always on, which
allows the classifier to model the prior prob-
ability distribution over the possible argument
labels.
Joint features These features were only defined
over pair-wise cliques: {whether the parent
and child head words do not match, parent syn-
tactic category + and child syntactic category,
parent relative position + child relative posi-
tion, parent relative position + child relative
position + predicate PoS + predicate lemma}.
5 Experimental Results
The model was trained on the full training set
after removing unparsable sentences, yielding
90,388 predicates and 1,971,985 binary features. A
Gaussian prior was used to regularise the model,
with variance σ2 = 1. Training was performed on
a 20 node PowerPC cluster, consuming a total of
62Gb of RAM and taking approximately 15 hours.
Decoding required only 3Gb of RAM and about 5
minutes for the 3,228 predicates in the development
set. Results are shown in Table 1.

6 Conclusion
Conditional random fields proved useful in mod-
elling the semantic structure of text when provided
with a parse tree. Our novel use of a tree structure
derived from the syntactic parse, allowed for parent-
child interactions to be accurately modelled, which
provided an improvement over a standard maximum
entropy classifier. In addition, the parse constituent
structure proved quite appropriate to the task, more
so than modelling the data as a sequence of words or
chunks, as has been done in previous approaches.
