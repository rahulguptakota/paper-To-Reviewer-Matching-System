The rise of social media has brought compu-
tational linguistics in ever-closer contact with
bad language: text that defies our expecta-
tions about vocabulary, spelling, and syntax.
This paper surveys the landscape of bad lan-
guage, and offers a critical review of the NLP
communitys response, which has largely fol-
lowed two paths: normalization and domain
adaptation. Each approach is evaluated in the
context of theoretical and empirical work on
computer-mediated communication. In addi-
tion, the paper presents a quantitative analy-
sis of the lexical diversity of social media text,
and its relationship to other corpora.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9632712">
As social media becomes an increasingly important
application domain for natural language processing,
we encounter language that is substantially different
from many benchmark corpora. The following ex-
amples are all from the social media service Twitter:
Work on farm Fri. Burning piles of brush
WindyFire got out of control. Thank God for
good naber He help get undr control Pants-
BurnLegWound. (Senator Charles Grassley)
Boom! Ya ur website suxx bro

...dats why pluto is pluto it can neva b a star
(Shaquille ONeil)
michelle obama great. job. and. whit all my.
respect she. look. great. congrats. to. her.
(Ozzie Guillen)
These examples are selected from celebrities (for
privacy reasons), but they contain linguistic chal-
lenges that are endemic to the medium, including
non-standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling,
vocabulary, and syntax. The consequences for lan-
guage technology are dire: a series of papers has
detailed how state-of-the-art natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) systems perform significantly worse
on social media text. In part-of-speech tagging, the
accuracy of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al.,
2003) falls from 97% on Wall Street Journal text to
85% accuracy on Twitter (Gimpel et al., 2011). In
named entity recognition, the CoNLL-trained Stan-
ford recognizer achieves 44% F-measure (Ritter et
al., 2011), down from 86% on the CoNLL test
set (Finkel et al., 2005). In parsing, Foster et al.
(2011) report double-digit decreases in accuracy for
four different state-of-the-art parsers when applied
to social media text.
The application of language technology to so-
cial media is potentially transformative, leveraging
the knowledge and perspectives of millions of peo-
ple. But to deliver on this potential, the problems
at the core of the NLP pipeline must be addressed.
A growing thread of research takes up this chal-
lenge, including a shared task and workshop on
parsing the web, with new corpora which appear
to sit somewhere between the Wall Street Journal
and Twitter on the spectrum of bad language (Petrov
and McDonald, 2012). But perhaps surprisingly,
very little of this research has considered why social
media language is so different. This review paper
attempts to shed some light on this question, sur-
veying a strong tradition of empirical and theoreti-

\x0ccal research on computer-mediated communication
(CMC). I argue that the two main computational ap-
proaches to dealing with bad language normaliza-
tion and domain adaptation are based on theories
of social media language that are not descriptively
accurate. I have worked and continue to work in
both of these areas, so I make this argument not as
a criticism of others, but in a spirit of self-reflection.
It is hoped that a greater engagement with sociolin-
guistic and CMC research will lead to new, nuanced
approaches to the challenge of bad language.
Why so much Twitter? Most of the examples
in this paper will focus on Twitter, a microblog-
ging service. Munro and Manning (2012) argue
that Twitter has unfairly dominated recent research,
at the expense of email and SMS text messages,
which they found to be both linguistically distinct
from Twitter and significantly more prevalent (in
2010). This matches earlier research arguing that
email contained relatively little neography, com-
pared with text messages and chat (Anis, 2007).
A crucial advantage for Twitter is that it is public
by default, while SMS and email are private. This
makes Twitter data less problematic from a privacy
standpoint,1 far easier to obtain, and more amenable
to target applications such as large-scale mining of
events (Sakaki et al., 2010; Benson et al., 2011) and
opinions (Sauper et al., 2011). Similar argument
could be made on behalf of other public social me-
dia, such as blog comments (Ali-Hasan and Adamic,
2007), forums, and chatrooms (Paolillo, 2001). The
main advantage of Twitter over these media is con-
venience in gathering large datasets through a sin-
gle streaming interface. More comparative evalu-
ation is needed to determine linguistic similarities
and differences between Twitter and these other me-
dia; Section 4 presents an evaluation of the lexical
similarity between Twitter and political blogs.

ple found that more than half of the respondents
agreed with the following partial explanations for
non-standard spelling on the internet: people are
unsure of the correct spellings, its faster, its be-
come the norm, and people want to represent their
own dialects and/or accents (Jones, 2010). Let us
now consider the evidence for these and other poten-
tial explanations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.938107">
2.1 Illiteracy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999737578947368">
Some commentators have fixated on the proposal
that the authors of non-standard language in social
media are simply unaware or incapable of using
more standard language (Thurlow, 2006). But em-
pirical research suggests that many users of bad lan-
guage are capable of using more traditional forms.
Drouin and Davis (2009) find no significant differ-
ences in the literacy scores of individuals who do
or do not use non-standard vocabulary in text mes-
sages. Tagliamonte and Denis (2008) review traces
of instant messaging conversations among students,
arguing that they pick and choose ... from the en-
tire stylistic repertoire of the language in a way that
would be impossible without skilled command of
both formal and informal registers. While news text
is usually more carefully composed and edited than
much of the language in social media, there is little
evidence that bad language results from an inability
to speak anything else.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99894">
2.2 Length limits
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999473941176471">
In the case of Twitter, the limit of 140 characters for
each message is frequently cited as an explanation
for bad language (Finin et al., 2010). Does Twitters
character limit cause users to prefer shorter words,
such as u instead of you? If so, one might expect
shortening to be used most frequently in messages
that are near the 140-character limit. Using a dataset
of one million English-language tweets (Bamman et
al., 2012), I have computed the average length of
messages containing both standard words and their
non-standard alternatives, focusing on the top five
non-standard shortenings identified by the automatic
method of Gouws et al. (2011a). The shortening ur
can substitute for both your and youre. While wit
and bout are also spellings for standard words, man-
ual examination of one hundred randomly selected
examples for each surface form revealed only one

case in which the standard meaning was intended for
wit, and none for bout.
The average message lengths are shown in Ta-
ble 1. In all five cases, the non-standard form tends
to be used in shorter messages not in long mes-
sages near the 140 character limit. Moreover, this
difference is substantially greater than the saving of
one or two characters offered by shortened form.
This is not consistent with the explanation that Twit-
ters character limit is the primary factor driving the
use of shortened forms. It is still possible that Twit-
ters length limitations might indirectly cause word
shortenings: for example, by legitimizing shortened
forms or causing authors to develop a habit of pre-
ferring them. But factors other than the length limit
must be recruited to explain why such conventions
or habits apply only to some messages and not oth-
ers.

2.3 Text input affordances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999543684210526">
Text input affordances whether standard key-
boards or predictive entry on mobile devices play
a role in computer-mediated communication that is
perhaps under-appreciated. Gouws et al. (2011b) in-
vestigate orthographic variation on Twitter, and find
differences across devices: for example, that mes-
sages from iPhones include more contractions than
messages from Blackberries, and that tweets sent
from the web browser are more likely to drop vow-
els. While each affordance facilitates some writ-
ing styles and inhibits others, the affordances them-
selves are unevenly distributed across users. For ex-
ample, older people may prefer standard keyboards,
and wealthier people may be more likely to own
iPhones. Affordances are a moving target: new de-
vices and software are constantly becoming avail-
able, the software itself may adapt to the users in-
put, and the user may adapt to the software and de-
vice.

2.4 Pragmatics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999361714285714">
Emoticons are frequently thought of as introduc-
ing an expressive, non-verbal component into writ-
ten language, mirroring the role played by facial ex-
pressions in speech (Walther and DAddario, 2001),
but they can also be seen as playing a pragmatic
function: marking an utterance as facetious, or
demonstrating a non-confrontational, less invested
stance (Dresner and Herring, 2010). In many cases,
phrasal abbreviations like lol (laugh out loud),
lmao (laughing my ass off), smh (shake my head),
and ikr (i know, right?) play a similar role: yea she
dnt like me lol; lmao Im playin son. A key differ-
ence from emoticons is that abbreviations can act
as constituents, as in smh at your ignorance. An-
other form of non-standard language is expressive
lengthening (e.g., coooolllllll), found by Brody and
Diakopoulos (2011) to indicate subjectivity and sen-
timent. In running dialogues such as in online
multiplayer games the symbols * and can play
an explicit pragmatic function (Collister, 2011; Col-
lister, 2012).

2.5 Social variables
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999199476190476">
A series of papers has documented the interac-
tions between social media text and social vari-
ables such as age (Burger and Henderson, 2006;
Argamon et al., 2007; Rosenthal and McKeown,
2011), gender (Burger et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2010),
race (Eisenstein et al., 2011), and location (Eisen-
stein et al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011). From
this literature, it is clear that many of the features
that characterize bad language have strong associa-
tions with specific social variables. In some cases,
these associations mirror linguistic variables known
from speech such as geographically-associated
lexical items like hella, or transcriptions of phono-
logical variables like g-dropping (Eisenstein et al.,
2010). But in other cases, apparently new lexical
items, such as the abbreviations ctfu, lls, and af,
acquire surprisingly strong associations with geo-
graphical areas and demographic groups (Eisenstein
et al., 2011).
A robust finding from the sociolinguistics litera-
ture is that non-standard forms that mark social vari-

<bodyText confidence="0.98570752631579">
\x0cables, such as regional dialects, are often inhibited in
formal registers (Labov, 1972). For example, while
the Pittsburgh spoken dialect sometimes features the
address term yinz (Johnstone et al., 2006), one would
not expect to find many examples in financial re-
ports. Other investigators have found that much of
the content in Twitter concerns social events and self
presentation (Ramage et al., 2010), which may en-
courage the use of less formal registers in which
socially-marketed language is uninhibited.
The use of non-standard language is often seen
as a form of identity work, signaling authentic-
ity, solidarity, or resistance to norms imposed from
above (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). In spoken lan-
guage, many of the linguistic variables that perform
identity work are phonological for example, Eck-
ert (2000) showed how the northern cities vowel
shift was used by a subset of suburban teenagers to
index affiliation with Detroit. The emergence of new
linguistic variables in social media suggests that this
identity work is as necessary in social media as it
is in spoken language. Some of these new variables
are transcriptions of existing spoken language vari-
ables: like finna, which transcribes fixing to. Oth-
ers abbreviations like ctfu and emoticons seem
to be linguistic inventions created to meet the needs
of social communication in a new medium. In an
early study of variation in social media, Paolillo
(1999) notes that code-switching between English
and Hindi also performs this type of identity work.
Finally, it is an uncomfortable fact that the text
in many of our most frequently-used corpora was
written and edited predominantly by working-age
white men. The Penn Treebank is composed of
professionally-written news text from 1989, when
minorities comprised 7.5% of the print journalism
workforce; the proportion of women in the journal-
ism workforce was first recorded in 1999, when it
was 37% (American Society of Newspaper Editors,
1999). In contrast, Twitter users in the USA con-
tain an equal proportion of men and women, and
a higher proportion of young adults and minorities
than in the population as a whole (Smith and Brewer,
2012). Such demographic differences are very likely
to lead to differences in language (Green, 2002;
Labov, 2001; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003).
Overall, the reasons for language diversity in so-
cial media are manifold, though some of the most
frequently cited explanations (illiteracy and length
restrictions) do not hold up to scrutiny. The in-
creasing prevalence of emoticons, phrasal abbrevi-
ations (lol, ctfu), and expressive lengthening may
reflect the increasing use of written language for
ephemeral social interaction, with the concomitant
need for multiple channels through which to express
multiple types of meaning. The fact many such neol-
ogisms are closely circumscribed in geography and
demographics may reflect diffusion through social
networks that are assortative on exactly these dimen-
sions (Backstrom et al., 2010; Thelwall, 2009). But
an additional consideration is that non-standard lan-
guage is deliberately deployed in the performance of
identity work and stancetaking. This seems a partic-
ularly salient explanation for the use of lexical vari-
ables that originate in spoken language (jawn, hella),
and for the orthographic transcription of phonolog-
ical variation (Eisenstein, 2013). Determining the
role and relative importance of social network diffu-
sion and identity work as factors in the diversifica-
tion of social media language is an exciting direction
for future research.
3 What can we do about it?
Having surveyed the landscape of bad language and
its possible causes, let us now turn to the responses
offered by the language technology research com-
munity.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99814">
3.1 Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996339">
One approach to dealing with bad language is to
turn it good: normalizing social media or SMS
messages to better conform to the sort of language
that our technology expects. Approaches to normal-
ization include the noisy-channel model (Cook and
Stevenson, 2009), string and distributional similar-
ity (Han and Baldwin, 2011; Han et al., 2012), se-
quence labeling (Choudhury et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2011a), and machine translation (Aw et al., 2006).
As this task has been the focus of substantial atten-
tion in recent years, labeled datasets have become
available and accuracies have climbed.
That said, it is surprisingly difficult to find a
precise definition of the normalization task. Writ-
ing before social media was a significant focus for
NLP, Sproat et al. (2001) proposed to replace non-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995983">

<bodyText confidence="0.99877852">
\x0cstandard words with the contextually appropriate
word or sequence of words. In some cases, this
seems clear enough: we can rewrite dats why pluto
is pluto with thats why... But it is not difficult to find
cases that are less clear, putting would-be normaliz-
ers in a difficult position. The labeled dataset of Han
and Baldwin (2011) addresses a more tractable sub-
set of the normalization problem, annotating only
token-to-token normalizations. Thus, imma a
transcription of Im gonna, which in turn transcribes
Im going to is not normalized in this dataset. Ab-
breviations like LOL and WTF are also not normal-
ized, even when they are used to abbreviate syntac-
tic constituents, as in wtf is the matter with you? Nor
are words like hella and jawn normalized, since they
have no obvious one-word transcription in standard
English. These decisions no doubt help to solidify
the reliability of the annotations, but they provide an
overly optimistic impression of the ability of string
edit distance and related similarity-based techniques
to normalize bad language. The resulting gold stan-
dard annotations seem little more amenable to au-
tomated parsing and information extraction than the
original text.
But if we critique normalization for not going
far enough, we must also ask whether it goes too
far. The logic of normalization presupposes that the
norm can be identified unambiguously, and that
there is a direct mapping from non-standard words
to the elements in this normal set. On closer exami-
nation, the norm reveals itself to be slippery. Whose
norm are we targeting? Should we normalize flvr to
flavor or flavour? Where does the normal end and
the abnormal begin? For example, Han and Baldwin
normalize ain to aint, but not all the way to isnt.
While aint is certainly well-known to speakers of
Standard American English, it does not appear in the
Penn Treebank and probably could not be used in the
Wall Street Journal, except in quotation.
Normalization is often impossible without chang-
ing the meaning of the text. Should we normalize the
final word of ya ur website suxx bro to brother? At
the very least, this adds semantic ambiguity where
there was none before (is she talking to her biolog-
ical brother? or possibly to a monk?). Language
variation does not arise from passing standard text
through a noisy channel; it often serves a pragmatic
and/or stancetaking (Du Bois, 2007) function. Elim-
inating variation would strip those additional lay-
ers of meaning from whatever propositional content
might survive the normalization process. Sarah Sil-
vermans ya ur website suxx bro can only be under-
stood as a critique from a caricatured persona the
type of person who ends sentences with bro. Sim-
ilarly, we can assume that Shaquille ONeil is ca-
pable of writing thats why Pluto is Pluto, but that
to do so would convey an undesirably didactic and
authoritative stance towards the audience and topic.
This is not to deny that there is great poten-
tial value in research aimed at understanding or-
thographic variation through a combination of lo-
cal context, string similarity, and related finite-state
machinery. Given the productivity of orthographic
substitutions in social media text, it is clear that lan-
guage technology must be made more robust. Nor-
malization may point the way towards such robust-
ness, even if we do not build an explicit normaliza-
tion component directly into the language process-
ing pipeline. Another potential benefit of this re-
search is to better understand the underlying ortho-
graphic processes that lead to the diversity of lan-
guage in social media, how these processes diffuse
over social networks, and how they impact compre-
hensibility for both the target and non-target audi-
ences.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999157">
3.2 Domain adaptation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997641777777778">
Rather than adapting text to fit our tools, we may
instead adapt our tools to fit the text. A series of
papers has followed the mold of NLP for Twit-
ter, including part-of-speech tagging (Gimpel et al.,
2011; Owoputi et al., 2013), named entity recogni-
tion (Finin et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2011b), parsing (Foster et al., 2011), dialogue mod-
eling (Ritter et al., 2010) and summarization (Sharifi
et al., 2010). These papers adapt various parts of the
natural language processing pipeline for social me-
dia text, and make use of a range of techniques:
preprocessing to normalize expressive length-
ening, and eliminate or group all hashtags,
usernames, and URLs (Gimpel et al., 2011;
Foster et al., 2011)
new labeled data, enabling the application of
semi-supervised learning (Finin et al., 2010;

downstream application (Liu et al., 2012)

tologies and topic models (Ritter et al., 2011)
Only a few of these techniques (normalization and
new annotation systems) are specific to social me-
dia; the rest can found in other domain adaptation
settings. Is domain adaptation appropriate for social
media? Darling et al. (2012) argue that social me-
dia is not a coherent domain at all, and that a POS
tagger for Twitter will not necessarily generalize to
other social media. One can go further: Twitter it-
self is not a unified genre, it is composed of many
different styles and registers, with widely varying
expectations for the degree of standardness and di-
mensions of variation (Androutsopoulos, 2011). I
am the co-author on a paper entitled Part-of-speech
tagging for Twitter, but if we take this title literally,
it is impossible on a trivial level: Twitter contains
text in dozens or hundreds of languages, including
many for which no POS tagger exists. Even within
a single language setting aside issues of code-
switching (Paolillo, 1996) Twitter and other so-
cial media can contain registers ranging from hash-
tag wordplay (Naaman et al., 2011) to the official
pronouncements of the British Monarchy. And even
if all good language is alike, bad language can be
bad in many different ways as Androutsopoulos
(2011) notes when contrasting the types of variation
encountered when visiting a gamer forum versus
joining the Twitter profile of a rap star.
4 The lexical coherence of social media
The internal coherence of social media and its
relationship to other types of text can be quan-
tified in terms of the similarity of distributions over
bigrams. While there are many techniques for com-
paring word distributions, I apply the relatively sim-
ple method of counting out-of-vocabulary (OOV) bi-
grams. The relationship between OOV rate and do-
main adaptation has been explored by McClosky et
al. (2010), who use it as a feature to predict how well
a parser will perform when applied across domains.2
Specifically, the datasets A and B are compared
by counting the number of bigram tokens in A that
are unseen in B. The following corpora are com-
pared:
Twitter-month: randomly selected tweets
from each month between January 2010 to Oc-
tober 2012 (Eisenstein et al., 2012).
Twitter-hour: randomly selected tweets from
each hour of the day, randomly sampled during
the period from January 2010 to October 2012.
Twitter-#: tweets in which the first token is a
hashtag. The hashtag itself is not included in
the bigram counts; see below for more details
on which bigrams are included.
Twitter-@: tweets in which the first token is a
username. The username itself is not included
in the bigram counts.

cuses on the degree of difference in the lexical distributions of

tokenized using NLTK (Bird et al., 2009). All to-
kens are downcased, and sequences of three or more
consecutive identical characters are reduced to three
characters (e.g., coooool coool). All Twitter cor-
pora are subject to the following filters: messages
must be from the United States and should be written
in English,4 they may not include hyperlinks (elim-
inating most marketing messages), they may not be
retweets, and the author must not have more than
1,000 followers or follow more than 1,000 people.
These criteria serve to eliminate text from celebri-
ties, businesses, or automated bots.
Twitter over time Figure 1 shows how the pro-
portion of out-of-vocabulary bigrams increases over
time. It is possible that the core features of language
are constant but the set of named entities that are
mentioned changes over time. To control for this,
the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech tagger (Owoputi et
al., 2013) was used to identify named entity men-
tions, and they were replaced with a special token.

Approximate language detection was performed as follows.
We first identify the 1000 most common words, then sort all au-
thors by the proportion of these types that they used, and elim-
inate the bottom 10%. This filtering mechanism eliminates in-
dividuals who never write in English, but a small amount of
foreign language still enters the dataset via code-switching au-
thors. The effect of more advanced language detection meth-
ods (Bergsma et al., 2012) on these results may be considered
in future work.

natures, reflecting differing topics and authors.
The OOV rate is standardized with respect to a one-
month time gap, where it is 24.4% when named en-
tities are included, and 21.3% when they are not.
These rates reach maxima at 25.2% and 22.0% re-
spectively, with dips at 12 and 24 months indicat-
ing cyclic yearly effects. While the proportion of
OOV tokens is smaller when named entities are not
included, the rate of growth is similar in each case.
The steadily increasingly rate of OOV bigrams sug-
gests that we cannot annotate our way out of the bad
language problem. An NLP system trained from
data gathered in January 2010 will be increasingly
outdated as time passes and social media language
continues to evolve.
One need not wait months to see language change
on Twitter: marked changes can be observed over
the course of a single day (Golder and Macy, 2011).
A quantitative comparison is shown in Figure 2.
Here the OOV rate is standardized with respect to
a one-hour gap, where it is 24.2% when named en-
tities are included, and 21.1% when they are not.
These rates rise monotonically as the time gap in-
creases, peaking at 25.1% and 21.9% respectively.
Such diurnal changes may reflect the diverse lan-
guage of the different types of authors who post
throughout the day.
Types of usage The Twitter-# and Twitter-@ cor-
pora are designed to capture the diversity of ways
in which social media is used to communicate.
Twitter-# contains tweets that begin with hashtags,
and are thus more likely to be part of running jokes

\x0cor trending topics (Naaman et al., 2011). Twitter-
@ contains tweets that begin with usernames an
addressing mechanism that is used to maintain dia-
logue threads on the site. These datasets are com-
pared with a set of randomly selected tweets from
June 2011, and with several other corpora: Penn
Treebank, the novel Infinite Jest, and text and com-
ments from political blogs. There was no attempt to
remove named entities from any of these corpora, as
such a comparison would merely reflect the different
accuracy levels of NER in each corpus.
The results are shown in Table 2. A few observa-
tions stand out. First, the Penn Treebank is the clear
outlier: a PTB dictionary has by far the most OOV
tokens for all three Twitter domains and Infinite Jest,
although it is a better match for the blog corpora
than Infinite Jest is. Second, the social media are
fairly internally coherent: the Twitter datasets bet-
ter match each other than any other corpus, with a
maximum OOV rate of 33.4 for Twitter-# against
Twitter-@, though this is significantly higher than
the OOV rate of 27.8 between two separate generic
Twitter samples drawn from the same month. Fi-
nally, the OOV rate increase between Twitter and
blogs also social media is substantial. Con-
trary to expectations, the Blog-body corpus was no
closer to the PTB standard than Blog-comment.
These results suggest that the Penn Treebank cor-
pus is so distant from social media that there are in-
deed substantial gains to be reaped by adapting from
news text towards generic Twitter or Blog target do-
mains. The internal differences within these social
media at least as measured by the distinctions
drawn in Table 2 are much smaller than the dif-
ferences between these corpora and the PTB stan-
dard. However, in the long run, the effectiveness
of this approach will be limited, as it is clear from
Figure 1 that social media is a moving target. Any
static system that we build today, whether by man-
ual annotation or automated adaptation, will see its
performance decay over time.

<bodyText confidence="0.9993511">
Language is shaped by a constant negotiation be-
tween processes that encourage change and linguis-
tic diversity, and countervailing processes that en-
force existing norms. The decision of the NLP com-
munity to focus so much effort on news text is em-
inently justified on practical grounds, but has unin-
tended consequences not just for technology but for
language itself. By developing software that works
best for standard linguistic forms, we throw the
weight of language technology behind those forms,
and against variants that are preferred by disempow-
ered groups. By adopting a model of normaliza-
tion, we declare one version of language to be the
norm, and all others to be outside that norm. By
adopting a model of domain adaptation, we con-
fuse a medium with a coherent domain. Adapting
language technology towards the median Tweet can
improve accuracy on average, but it is certain to
leave many forms of language out.
Much of the current research on the relationship
between social media language and metadata has the
goal of using language to predict the metadata
revealing who is a woman or a man, who is from
Oklahoma or New Jersey, and so on. This perspec-
tive on social variables and personal identity ignores
the local categories that are often more linguisti-
cally salient (Eckert, 2008); worse, it strips individ-
uals of any agency in using language as a resource
to create and shape their identity (Coupland, 2007),
and conceals the role that language plays in creating
and perpetuating categories like gender (Bucholtz
and Hall, 2005). An alternative possibility is to re-
verse the relationship between language and meta-
data, using metadata to achieve a more flexible and
heterogeneous domain adaptation that is sensitive to
the social factors that shape variation. Such a re-
versal would help language technology to move be-
yond false dichotomies between normal and abnor-
mal text, source and target domains, and good and
bad language.

This paper surveys the landscape of bad language, and offers a critical review of the NLP communitys response, which has largely followed two paths: normalization and domain adaptation. Each approach is evaluated in the context of theoretical and empirical work on computer-mediated communication. In addition, the paper presents a quantitative analysis of the lexical diversity of social media text, and its relationship to other corpora.</abstract>

Does Twitters character limit cause users to prefer shorter words, such as u instead of you? If so, one might expect shortening to be used most frequently in messages that are near the 140-character limit. Using a dataset of one million English-language tweets (Bamman et al., 2012), I have computed the average length of messages containing both standard words and their non-standard alternatives, focusing on the top five non-standard shortenings identified by the automatic method of Gouws et al. (2011a). The shortening ur can substitute for both your and youre.

This matches earlier research arguing that email contained relatively little neography, compared with text messages and chat (Anis, 2007). A crucial advantage for Twitter is that it is public by default, while SMS and email are private. This makes Twitter data less problematic from a privacy standpoint,1 far easier to obtain, and more amenable to target applications such as large-scale mining of events (Sakaki et al., 2010; Benson et al., 2011) and opinions (Sauper et al., 2011). Similar argument could be made on behalf of other public social media, such as blog comments (Ali-Hasan and Adamic, 2007), forums, and chatrooms (Paolillo, 2001). The main advantage of Twitter over these media is convenience in gathering large datasets through a single streaming interface.

A survey of laypeo1 boyd and Crawford (2012) note that public by default data still raises important ethical considerations. ple found that more than half of the respondents agreed with the following partial explanations for non-standard spelling on the internet: people are unsure of the correct spellings, its faster, its become the norm, and people want to represent their own dialects and/or accents (Jones, 2010). Let us now consider the evidence for these and other potential explanations. 2.1 Illiteracy Some commentators have fixated on the proposal that the authors of non-standard language in social media are simply unaware or incapa</context>

For example, while the Pittsburgh spoken dialect sometimes features the address term yinz (Johnstone et al., 2006), one would not expect to find many examples in financial reports. Other investigators have found that much of the content in Twitter concerns social events and self presentation (Ramage et al., 2010), which may encourage the use of less formal registers in which socially-marketed language is uninhibited. The use of non-standard language is often seen as a form of identity work, signaling authenticity, solidarity, or resistance to norms imposed from above (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). In spoken language, many of the linguistic variables that perform identity work are phonological for example, Eckert (2000) showed how the northern cities vowel shift was used by a subset of suburban teenagers to index affiliation with Detroit. The emergence of new linguistic variables in social media suggests that this identity work is as necessary in social media as it is in spoken language. Some of these new variables are transcriptions of existing spoken language variables: like finna, which transcribes fixing to.

In many cases, phrasal abbreviations like lol (laugh out loud), lmao (laughing my ass off), smh (shake my head), and ikr (i know, right?) play a similar role: yea she dnt like me lol; lmao Im playin son. A key difference from emoticons is that abbreviations can act as constituents, as in smh at your ignorance. Another form of non-standard language is expressive lengthening (e.g., coooolllllll), found by Brody and Diakopoulos (2011) to indicate subjectivity and sentiment.

Let us now consider the evidence for these and other potential explanations. 2.1 Illiteracy Some commentators have fixated on the proposal that the authors of non-standard language in social media are simply unaware or incapable of using more standard language (Thurlow, 2006). But empirical research suggests that many users of bad language are capable of using more traditional forms. Drouin and Davis (2009) find no significant differences in the literacy scores of individuals who do or do not use non-standard vocabulary in text messages. Tagliamonte and Denis (2008) review traces of instant messaging conversations among students, arguing that they pick and choose ... from the entire stylistic repertoire of the language in a way that would be impossible without skilled command of both formal and informal registers.

At the very least, this adds semantic ambiguity where there was none before (is she talking to her biological brother? or possibly to a monk?). Language variation does not arise from passing standard text through a noisy channel; it often serves a pragmatic and/or stancetaking (Du Bois, 2007) function. Eliminating variation would strip those additional layers of meaning from whatever propositional content might survive the normalization process.

In contrast, Twitter users in the USA contain an equal proportion of men and women, and a higher proportion of young adults and minorities than in the population as a whole (Smith and Brewer, 2012). Such demographic differences are very likely to lead to differences in language (Green, 2002; Labov, 2001; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003). Overall, the reasons for language diversity in social media are manifold, though some of the most frequently cited explanations (illiteracy and length restrictions) do not hold up to scrutiny. The increasing prevalence of emoticons, phrasal abbreviations (lol, ctfu), and expressive lengthening may reflect the increasing use of written language for ephemeral social interaction, with the concomitant need for multiple channels through which to express multiple types of meaning.

Other investigators have found that much of the content in Twitter concerns social events and self presentation (Ramage et al., 2010), which may encourage the use of less formal registers in which socially-marketed language is uninhibited. The use of non-standard language is often seen as a form of identity work, signaling authenticity, solidarity, or resistance to norms imposed from above (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). In spoken language, many of the linguistic variables that perform identity work are phonological for example, Eckert (2000) showed how the northern cities vowel shift was used by a subset of suburban teenagers to index affiliation with Detroit. The emergence of new linguistic variables in social media suggests that this identity work is as necessary in social media as it is in spoken language. Some of these new variables are transcriptions of existing spoken language variables: like finna, which transcribes fixing to. Others abbreviations like ctfu and emoticons seem to be linguistic inventions created to meet the needs of social communication in a new medium.

Adapting language technology towards the median Tweet can improve accuracy on average, but it is certain to leave many forms of language out. Much of the current research on the relationship between social media language and metadata has the goal of using language to predict the metadata revealing who is a woman or a man, who is from Oklahoma or New Jersey, and so on. This perspective on social variables and personal identity ignores the local categories that are often more linguistically salient (Eckert, 2008); worse, it strips individuals of any agency in using language as a resource to create and shape their identity (Coupland, 2007), and conceals the role that language plays in creating and perpetuating categories like gender (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). An alternative possibility is to reverse the relationship between language and metadata, using metadata to achieve a more flexible and heterogeneous domain adaptation that is sensitive to the social factors that shape variation. Such a reversal would help language technology to move beyond false dichotomies between normal and abnormal text, source</context>

While there are many techniques for comparing word distributions, I apply the relatively simple method of counting out-of-vocabulary (OOV) bigrams. The relationship between OOV rate and domain adaptation has been explored by McClosky et al. (2010), who use it as a feature to predict how well a parser will perform when applied across domains.2 Specifically, the datasets A and B are compared by counting the number of bigram tokens in A that are unseen in B. The following corpora are compared: Twitter-month: randomly selected tweets from each month between January 2010 to October 2012 (Eisenstein et al., 2012). Twitter-hour: randomly selected tweets from each hour of the day, randomly sampled during the period from January 2010 to October 2012. Twitter-#: tweets in which the first token is a hashtag. The hashtag itself is not included in the bigram counts; see below for more details on which bigrams are included. Twitter-@: tweets in which the first token is a username. The username itself is not included in the bigram counts. Penn Treebank: sections 2-21 Infinite Jest: the text of the 1996 novel by David Foster Wallace (Wallace, 2012).

The fact many such neologisms are closely circumscribed in geography and demographics may reflect diffusion through social networks that are assortative on exactly these dimensions (Backstrom et al., 2010; Thelwall, 2009). But an additional consideration is that non-standard language is deliberately deployed in the performance of identity work and stancetaking. This seems a particularly salient explanation for the use of lexical variables that originate in spoken language (jawn, hella), and for the orthographic transcription of phonological variation (Eisenstein, 2013). Determining the role and relative importance of social network diffusion and identity work as factors in the diversification of social media language is an exciting direction for future research. 3 What can we do about it? Having surveyed the landscape of bad language and its possible causes, let us now turn to the responses offered by the language technology research community. 3.1 Normalization One approach to dealing with bad language is to turn it good: normalizing social media or SMS messages to better conform to the sort of language that our technology expects.

Does Twitters character limit cause users to prefer shorter words, such as u instead of you? If so, one might expect shortening to be used most frequently in messages that are near the 140-character limit. Using a dataset of one million English-language tweets (Bamman et al., 2012), I have computed the average length of messages containing both standard words and their non-standard alternatives, focusing on the top five non-standard shortenings identified by the automatic method of Gouws et al.

While the proportion of OOV tokens is smaller when named entities are not included, the rate of growth is similar in each case. The steadily increasingly rate of OOV bigrams suggests that we cannot annotate our way out of the bad language problem. An NLP system trained from data gathered in January 2010 will be increasingly outdated as time passes and social media language continues to evolve. One need not wait months to see language change on Twitter: marked changes can be observed over the course of a single day (Golder and Macy, 2011). A quantitative comparison is shown in Figure 2. Here the OOV rate is standardized with respect to a one-hour gap, where it is 24.2% when named entities are included, and 21.1% when they are not. These rates rise monotonically as the time gap increases, peaking at 25.1% and 21.9% respectively.

Let us now consider the evidence for these and other potential explanations. 2.1 Illiteracy Some commentators have fixated on the proposal that the authors of non-standard language in social media are simply unaware or incapable of using more standard language (Thurlow, 2006). But empirical research suggests that many users of bad language are capable of using more traditional forms. Drouin and Davis (2009) find no significant differences in the literacy scores of individuals who do or do not use non-standard vocabulary in text messages.

While there are many techniques for comparing word distributions, I apply the relatively simple method of counting out-of-vocabulary (OOV) bigrams. The relationship between OOV rate and domain adaptation has been explored by McClosky et al. (2010), who use it as a feature to predict how well a parser will perform when applied across domains.2 Specifically, the datasets A and B are compared by counting the number of bigram tokens in A that are unseen in B. The following corpora are compared: Twitter-month: randomly selected tweets from each month between January 2010 to October 2012 (Eisenstein et al., 2012).

I have worked and continue to work in both of these areas, so I make this argument not as a criticism of others, but in a spirit of self-reflection. It is hoped that a greater engagement with sociolinguistic and CMC research will lead to new, nuanced approaches to the challenge of bad language. Why so much Twitter? Most of the examples in this paper will focus on Twitter, a microblogging service. Munro and Manning (2012) argue that Twitter has unfairly dominated recent research, at the expense of email and SMS text messages, which they found to be both linguistically distinct from Twitter and significantly more prevalent (in 2010). This matches earlier research arguing that email contained relatively little neography, compared with text messages and chat (Anis, 2007). A crucial advantage for Twitter is that it is public by default, while SMS and email are private.

A series of papers has followed the mold of NLP for Twitter, including part-of-speech tagging (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013), named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011b), parsing (Foster et al., 2011), dialogue modeling (Ritter et al., 2010) and summarization (Sharifi et al., 2010).

It is possible that the core features of language are constant but the set of named entities that are mentioned changes over time. To control for this, the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013) was used to identify named entity mentions, and they were replaced with a special token. 3 https://github.com/brendano/tweetmotif 4 Approximate language detection was performed as follows. We first identify the 1000 most common words, then sort all authors by the proportion of these types that they used, and eliminate the bottom 10%. This filtering mechanism eliminates individuals who never write in English, but a small amount of foreign language still enters the dataset via code-switching authors.

The emergence of new linguistic variables in social media suggests that this identity work is as necessary in social media as it is in spoken language. Some of these new variables are transcriptions of existing spoken language variables: like finna, which transcribes fixing to. Others abbreviations like ctfu and emoticons seem to be linguistic inventions created to meet the needs of social communication in a new medium. In an early study of variation in social media, Paolillo (1999) notes that code-switching between English and Hindi also performs this type of identity work. Finally, it is an uncomfortable fact that the text in many of our most frequently-used corpora was written and edited predominantly by working-age white men. The Penn Treebank is composed of professionally-written news text from 1989, when minorities comprised 7.5% of the print journalism workforce; the proportion of women in the journalism workforce was first recorded in 1999, when it was 37% (American Society of Newspaper Editors, 1999).

For example, while the Pittsburgh spoken dialect sometimes features the address term yinz (Johnstone et al., 2006), one would not expect to find many examples in financial reports. Other investigators have found that much of the content in Twitter concerns social events and self presentation (Ramage et al., 2010), which may encourage the use of less formal registers in which socially-marketed language is uninhibited. The use of non-standard language is often seen as a form of identity work, signaling authenticity, solidarity, or resistance to norms imposed from above (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). In spoken language, many of the linguistic variables that perform identity work are phonological for example, Eckert (2000) showed how the northern cities vowel shift was used by a subset of suburban teenagers to index affiliation with Detroit.

This matches earlier research arguing that email contained relatively little neography, compared with text messages and chat (Anis, 2007). A crucial advantage for Twitter is that it is public by default, while SMS and email are private. This makes Twitter data less problematic from a privacy standpoint,1 far easier to obtain, and more amenable to target applications such as large-scale mining of events (Sakaki et al., 2010; Benson et al., 2011) and opinions (Sauper et al., 2011).

A series of papers has followed the mold of NLP for Twitter, including part-of-speech tagging (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013), named entity recognition (Finin et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011b), parsing (Foster et al., 2011), dialogue modeling (Ritter et al., 2010) and summarization (Sharifi et al., 2010). These papers adapt various parts of the natural language processing pipeline for social media text, and make use of a range of techniques: preprocessing to normalize expressive lengthening, and eliminate or group all hashtags, usernames, and URLs (Gimpel et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2011) new labeled data, enabling the application of semi-supervised learning (Finin et al., 2010; Gimpel et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011) 363 \x0c new annotation schemes specifically customized for social media text (Gimpel et al., 2011) self-training on unlabeled social media text (Foster et al., 2011) distrib</context>

The Penn Treebank is composed of professionally-written news text from 1989, when minorities comprised 7.5% of the print journalism workforce; the proportion of women in the journalism workforce was first recorded in 1999, when it was 37% (American Society of Newspaper Editors, 1999). In contrast, Twitter users in the USA contain an equal proportion of men and women, and a higher proportion of young adults and minorities than in the population as a whole (Smith and Brewer, 2012). Such demographic differences are very likely to lead to differences in language (Green, 2002; Labov, 2001; Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003). Overall, the reasons for language diversity in social media are manifold, though some of the most frequently cited explanations (illiteracy and length restrictions) do not hold up to scrutiny. The increasing prevalence of emoticons, phrasal abbreviations (lol, ctfu), and expressive lengthening may reflect the increasing use of written language for ephemeral social interaction, with the concomitant need for multiple channels through which to express mul</context>

Approaches to normalization include the noisy-channel model (Cook and Stevenson, 2009), string and distributional similarity (Han and Baldwin, 2011; Han et al., 2012), sequence labeling (Choudhury et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011a), and machine translation (Aw et al., 2006). As this task has been the focus of substantial attention in recent years, labeled datasets have become available and accuracies have climbed. That said, it is surprisingly difficult to find a precise definition of the normalization task. Writing before social media was a significant focus for NLP, Sproat et al. (2001) proposed to replace non362 \x0cstandard words with the contextually appropriate word or sequence of words. In some cases, this seems clear enough: we can rewrite dats why pluto is pluto with thats why... But it is not difficult to find cases that are less clear, putting would-be normalizers in a difficult position. The labeled dataset of Han and Baldwin (2011) addresses a more tractable subset of the normalization problem, annotating only token-to-token normalizations. Thus, imma a transcription of Im gonna, which in turn transcribes Im going to is not normalized in this dataset. Abbreviation</context>

The increasing prevalence of emoticons, phrasal abbreviations (lol, ctfu), and expressive lengthening may reflect the increasing use of written language for ephemeral social interaction, with the concomitant need for multiple channels through which to express multiple types of meaning. The fact many such neologisms are closely circumscribed in geography and demographics may reflect diffusion through social networks that are assortative on exactly these dimensions (Backstrom et al., 2010; Thelwall, 2009). But an additional consideration is that non-standard language is deliberately deployed in the performance of identity work and stancetaking. This seems a particularly salient explanation for the use of lexical variables that originate in spoken language (jawn, hella), and for the orthographic transcription of phonological variation (Eisenstein, 2013). Determining the role and relative importance of social network diffusion and identity work as factors in the diversification of social media language is an exciting direction for future research. 3 What can we do about it?

In part-of-speech tagging, the accuracy of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) falls from 97% on Wall Street Journal text to 85% accuracy on Twitter (Gimpel et al., 2011). In named entity recognition, the CoNLL-trained Stanford recognizer achieves 44% F-measure (Ritter et al., 2011), down from 86% on the CoNLL test set (Finkel et al., 2005). In parsing, Foster et al.

For example, older people may prefer standard keyboards, and wealthier people may be more likely to own iPhones. Affordances are a moving target: new devices and software are constantly becoming available, the software itself may adapt to the users input, and the user may adapt to the software and device. 2.4 Pragmatics Emoticons are frequently thought of as introducing an expressive, non-verbal component into written language, mirroring the role played by facial expressions in speech (Walther and DAddario, 2001), but they can also be seen as playing a pragmatic function: marking an utterance as facetious, or demonstrating a non-confrontational, less invested stance (Dresner and Herring, 2010). In many cases, phrasal abbreviations like lol (laugh out loud), lmao (laughing my ass off), smh (shake my head), and ikr (i know, right?) play a similar role: yea she dnt like me lol; lmao Im playin son. A key difference from emoticons is that abbreviations can act as constituents, as in smh at your ignorance.
