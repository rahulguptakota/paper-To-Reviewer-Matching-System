Abstract
This paper addresses a new task in sentiment
classification, called multi-domain sentiment
classification, that aims to improve perform-
ance through fusing training data from multi-
ple domains. To achieve this, we propose two
approaches of fusion, feature-level and classi-
fier-level, to use training data from multiple
domains simultaneously. Experimental stud-
ies show that multi-domain sentiment classi-
fication using the classifier-level approach
performs much better than single domain
classification (using the training data indi-
vidually).
1 Introduction
Sentiment classification is a special task of text
categorization that aims to classify documents
according to their opinion of, or sentiment toward
a given subject (e.g., if an opinion is supported or
not) (Pang et al., 2002). This task has created a
considerable interest due to its wide applications.
Sentiment classification is a very domain-
specific problem; training a classifier using the
data from one domain may fail when testing
against data from another. As a result, real
application systems usually require some labeled
data from multiple domains, guaranteeing an
acceptable performance for different domains.
However, each domain has a very limited amount
of training data due to the fact that creating large-
scale high-quality labeled corpora is difficult and
time-consuming. Given the limited multi-domain
training data, an interesting task arises, how to
best make full use of all training data to improve
sentiment classification performance. We name
this new task, ‘multi-domain sentiment
classification’.
In this paper, we propose two approaches to
multi-domain sentiment classification. In the first,
called feature-level fusion, we combine the feature
sets from all the domains into one feature set.
Using the unified feature set, we train a classifier
using all the training data regardless of domain. In
the second approach, classifier-level fusion, we
train a base classifier using the training data from
each domain and then apply combination methods
to combine the base classifiers.
2 Related Work
Sentiment classification has become a hot topic
since the publication work that discusses classifi-
cation of movie reviews by Pang et al. (2002).
This was followed by a great many studies into
sentiment classification focusing on many do-
mains besides that of movie.
Research into sentiment classification over
multiple domains remains sparse. It is worth not-
ing that Blitzer et al. (2007) deal with the domain
adaptation problem for sentiment classification
where labeled data from one domain is used to
train a classifier for classifying data from a differ-
ent domain. Our work focuses on the problem of
how to make multiple domains ‘help each other’
when all contain some labeled samples. These two
problems are both important for real applications
of sentiment classification.
3 Our Approaches
3.1 Problem Statement
In a standard supervised classification problem,
we seek a predictor f (also called a classifier) that
257
maps an input vector x to the corresponding class
label y. The predictor is trained on a finite set of
labeled examples { ( , )
i i
X Y } (i=1,…,n) and its
objective is to minimize expected error, i.e.,
l argmin ( ( ), )
n
i i
f i
f L f X Y
∈
= ∑
Η
Where L is a prescribed loss function and H is a
set of functions called the hypothesis space, which
consists of functions from x to y. In sentiment
classification, the input vector of one document is
constructed from weights of terms. The terms
1
( ,..., )
N
t t are possibly words, word n-grams, or
even phrases extracted from the training data, with
N being the number of terms. The output label y
has a value of 1 or -1 representing a positive or
negative sentiment classification.
In multi-domain classification, m different
domains are indexed by k={1,…,m}, each with
k
n training samples ( , )
k k
i i
X Y {1,..., }
k k
i n
= . A
straightforward approach is to train a predictor k
f
for the k-th domain only using the training
data {( , )}
k k
i i
X Y . We call this approach single
domain classification and show its architecture in
Figure 1.

tion.
3.2 Feature-level Fusion Approach
Although terms are extracted from multiple do-
mains, some occur in all domains and convey the
same sentiment (this can be called global senti-
ment information). For example, some terms like
‘excellent’ and ‘perfect’ express positive senti-
ment information independent of domain. To learn
the global sentiment information more correctly,
we can pool the training data from all domains for
training. Our first approach is using a common set
of terms 1
( ' ,..., ' )
all
N
t t to construct a uniform fea-
ture vector '
x and then train a predictor using all
training data:
m
1 1
argmin ( ( ' ), )
k
k k
all all k
n
m
all i i
f k i
f L f X Y
∈ = =
= ∑∑
Η
We call this approach feature-level fusion and
show its architecture in Figure 2. The common set
of terms is the union of the term sets from
multiple domains.
Figure 2: The architecture of the feature-level fusion
approach
Feature-level fusion approach is simple to
implement and needs no extra labeled data. Note
that training data from different domains
contribute differently to the learning process for a
specific domain. For example, given data from
three domains, books, DVDs and kitchen, we
decide to train a classifier for classifying reviews
from books. As the training data from DVDs is
much more similar to books than that from
kitchen (Blitzer et al., 2007), we should give the
data from DVDs a higher weight. Unfortunately,
the feature-level fusion approach lacks the
capacity to do this. A more qualified approach is
required to deal with the differences among the
classification abilities of training data from
different domains.
3.3 Classifier-level Fusion Approach
As mentioned in sub-Section 2.1, single domain
classification is used to train a single classifier for
each domain using the training data in the corre-
sponding domain. As all these single classifiers
aim to determine the sentiment orientation of a
document, a single classifier can certainly be used
to classify documents from other domains. Given
multiple single classifiers, our second approach is
to combine them to be a multiple classifier system
for sentiment classification. We call this approach
classifier-level fusion and show its architecture in
Figure 3. This approach consists of two main steps:

(1) train multiple base classifiers (2) combine the
base classifiers. In the first step, the base classifi-
ers are multiple single classifiers k
f (k=1,…,m)
from all domains. In the second step, many com-
bination methods can be applied to combine the
base classifiers. A well-known method called
meta-learning (ML) has been shown to be very
effective (Vilalta and Drissi, 2002). The key idea
behind this method is to train a meta-classifier
with input attributes that are the output of the base
classifiers.

probability distribution over the set of classes

Each meta-classifier is then used to test the testing
data from the same domain.
Different from the feature-level approach, the
classifier-level approach treats the training data
from different domains individually and thus has
the ability to take the differences in classification
abilities into account.
4 Experiments
Data Set: We carry out our experiments on the
labeled product reviews from four domains: books,
DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances1
. Each
domain contains 1,000 positive and 1,000
negative reviews.
Experiment Implementation: We apply SVM
algorithm to construct our classifiers which has
been shown to perform better than many other
classification algorithms (Pang et al., 2002). Here,
we use LIBSVM2
with a linear kernel function for
training and testing. In our experiments, the data
in each domain are partitioned randomly into
training data, development data and testing data
with the proportion of 70%, 20% and 10%
respectively. The development data are used to
train the meta-classifier.
Baseline: The baseline uses the single domain
classification approach mentioned in sub-Section
2.1. We test four different feature sets to construct
our feature vector. First, we use unigrams (e.g.,
‘happy’) as features and perform the standard fea-
ture selection process to find the optimal feature
set of unigrams (1Gram). The selection method is
Bi-Normal Separation (BNS) that is reported to be
excellent in many text categorization tasks (For-
man, 2003). The criterion of the optimization is to
find the set of unigrams with the best performance
on the development data through selecting the
features with high BNS scores. Then, we get the
optimal word bi-gram (e.g., ‘very happy’) (2Gram)
and mixed feature set (1+2Gram) in the same way.
The fourth feature set (1Gram+2Gram) also con-
sists of unigrams and bi-grams just like the third
one. The difference between them lies in their se-
lection strategy. The third feature set is obtained
through selecting the unigrams and bi-grams with
high BNS scores while the fourth one is obtained
through simply uniting the two optimal sets of
1Gram and 2Gram.
From Table 1, we see that 1Gram+2Gram fea-
tures perform much better than other types of fea-
tures, which implies that we need to select good
unigram and bi-gram features separately before
combine them. Although the size of our training
data are smaller than that reported in Blitzer et al.

(2007) (70% vs. 80%), the classification perform-
ance is comparative to theirs.
We implement the fusion using 1+2Gram and
1Gram+2Gram respectively. From Figure 4, we
see that both the two fusion approaches generally
outperform single domain classification when us-
ing 1+2Gram features. They increase the average
accuracy from 0.8 to 0.82375 and 0.83875, a sig-
nificant relative error reduction of 11.87% and
19.38% over baseline.

However, when the performance of baseline in-
creases, the feature level approach fails to help the
performance improvement in three domains. This
is mainly because the base classifiers perform ex-
tremely unbalanced on the testing data of these
domains. For example, the four base classifiers
from Books, DVDs, Electronics, and Kitchen
achieve the accuracies of 0.675, 0.62, 0.85, and
0.79 on the testing data from Electronics respec-
tively. Dealing with such an unbalanced perform-
ance, we definitely need to put enough high
weight on the training data from Electronics.
However, the feature-level fusion approach sim-
ply pools all training data from different domains
and treats them equally. Thus it can not capture
the unbalanced information. In contrast, meta-
learning is able to learn the unbalance automati-
cally through training the meta-classifier using the
development data. Therefore, it can still increase
the average accuracy from 0.8325 to 0.8625, an
impressive relative error reduction of 17.91% over
baseline.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose two approaches to multi-
domain classification task on sentiment classifica-
tion. Empirical studies show that the classifier-
level approach generally outperforms the feature
approach. Compared to single domain classifica-
tion, multi-domain classification with the classi-
fier-level approach can consistently achieve much
better results.
