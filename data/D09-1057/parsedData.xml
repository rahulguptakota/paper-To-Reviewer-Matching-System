In this paper, we investigate how an ac-
curate question classifier contributes to
a question answering system. We first
present a Maximum Entropy (ME) based
question classifier which makes use of
head word features and their WordNet hy-
pernyms. We show that our question clas-
sifier can achieve the state of the art per-
formance in the standard UIUC question
dataset. We then investigate quantitatively
the contribution of this question classifier
to a feature driven question answering sys-
tem. With our accurate question classifier
and some standard question answer fea-
tures, our question answering system per-
forms close to the state of the art using
TREC corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584393442623">
Question answering has drawn significant atten-
tion from the last decade (Prager, 2006). It at-
tempts to answer the question posed in natural
language by providing the answer phrase rather
than the whole documents. An important step in
question answering (QA) is to classify the ques-
tion to the anticipated type of the answer. For
example, the question of Who discovered x-rays
should be classified into the type of human (indi-
vidual). This information would narrow down the
search space to identify the correct answer string.
In addition, this information can suggest different
strategies to search and verify a candidate answer.
In fact, the combination of question classification
and the named entity recognition is a key approach
in modern question answering systems (Voorhees
and Dang, 2005).
The question classification is by no means triv-
ial: Simply using question wh-words can not
achieve satisfactory results. The difficulty lies
in classifying the what and which type questions.
Considering the example What is the capital of Yu-
goslavia, it is of location (city) type, while What
is the pH scale is of definition type. As with
the previous work of (Li and Roth, 2002; Li and
Roth, 2006; Krishnan et al., 2005; Moschitti et
al., 2007), we propose a feature driven statistical
question classifier (Huang et al., 2008). In partic-
ular, we propose head word feature and augment
semantic features of such head words using Word-
Net. In addition, Lesks word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) algorithm is adapted and the depth of
hypernym feature is optimized. With further aug-
ment of other standard features such as unigrams,
we can obtain accuracy of 89.0% using ME model
for 50 fine classes over UIUC dataset.
In addition to building an accurate question
classifier, we investigate the contribution of this
question classifier to a feature driven question an-
swering rank model. It is worth noting that, most
of the features we used in question answering rank
model, depend on the question type information.
For instance, if a question is classified as a type of
sport, we then only care about whether there are
sport entities existing in the candidate sentences.
It is expected that a fine grained named entity rec-
ognizer (NER) should make good use of the accu-
rate question type information. However, due to
the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we
employ the Stanford NER package (Finkel et al.,
2005) which identifies only four types of named
entities. Even with such a coarse named entity
recognizer, the experiments show that the question
classifier plays an important role in determining
the performance of a question answering system.
The rest of the paper is organized as follow-
ing. Section 2 reviews the maximum entropy
model which are used in both question classifica-
tion and question answering ranking. Section 3
presents the features used in question classifica-
tion. Section 4 presents the question classification

Maximum entropy (ME) models (Berger et al.,
1996; Manning and Klein, 2003), also known as
log-linear and exponential learning models, pro-
vide a general purpose machine learning technique
for classification and prediction which has been
successfully applied to natural language process-
ing including part of speech tagging, named entity
recognition etc. Maximum entropy models can in-
tegrate features from many heterogeneous infor-
mation sources for classification. Each feature
corresponds to a constraint on the model. Given
a training set of (C, D), where C is a set of class
labels and D is a set of feature represented data
points, the maximal entropy model attempts to
maximize the log likelihood

where fi(c, d) are feature indicator functions. We
use ME models for both question classification
and question answer ranking. In question answer
context, such function, for instance, could be the
presence or absence of dictionary entities (as pre-
sented in Section 5.2) associated with a particular
class type (either true or false, indicating a sen-
tence can or cannot answer the question). i are
the parameters need to be estimated which reflects
the importance of fi(c, d) in prediction.

Li and Roth (2002) have developed a machine
learning approach which uses the SNoW learning
architecture. They have compiled the UIUC ques-
tion classification dataset1 which consists of 5500
training and 500 test questions.2 All questions in
the dataset have been manually labeled according
to the coarse and fine grained categories as shown
in Table 1, with coarse classes (in bold) followed
by their fine classes.
The UIUC dataset has laid a platform for the
follow-up research including (Hacioglu and Ward,

Krishnan et al., 2005; Moschitti et al., 2007). In
contrast to Li and Roth (2006)s approach which
makes use of a very rich feature set, we propose
to use a compact yet effective feature set. The fea-
tures are briefly described as following. More de-
tailed information can be found at (Huang et al.,
2008).
Question wh-word The wh-word feature is the
question wh-word in given questions. For ex-
ample, the wh-word of question What is the
population of China is what.
Head Word head word is defined as one single
word specifying the object that the question
seeks. For example the head word of What
is a group of turkeys called, is turkeys. This
is different to previous work including (Li
and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005) which
has suggested a contiguous span of words
(a group of turkeys in this example). The
single word definition effectively avoids the
noisy information brought by non-head word
of the span (group in this case). A syntac-
tic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and the
Collins rules (Collins, 1999) are modified to
extract such head words.
WordNet Hypernym WordNet hypernyms are
extracted for the head word of a given ques-
tion. The classic Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986)
is used to compute the most probable sense
for a head word in the question context, and
then the hypernyms are extracted based on
that sense. The depth of hypernyms is set to

<bodyText confidence="0.995239866666667">
\x0csix with trial and error.3 Hypernyms features
capture the general terms of extracted head
word. For instance, the head word of ques-
tion What is the proper name for a female
walrus is extracted as walrus and its direct
hypernyms such as mammal and animal are
extracted as informative features to predict
the correct question type of ENTY:animal.
Unigram words Bag of words features. Such
features provide useful question context in-
formation.
Word shape Five word shape features, namely all
upper case, all lower case, mixed case, all
digits, and other are used to serve as a coarse
named entity recognizer.

We use Stanford named entity recognizer (NER)
(Finkel et al., 2005) to identify CoNLL style NEs7
as possible answer strings in a candidate sentence
for a given type of question. In particular, if the
question is ABBR type, we tag CoNLL LOC,
ORG and MISC entities as candidate answers; If
the question is HUMAN type, we tag CoNLL PER
and ORG entities; And if the question is LOC
type, we tag CoNLL LOC and MISC entities. For
other types of questions, we assume there is no
candidate CoNLL NEs to tag. We create a binary
feature NE to indicate the presence or absence of
tagged CoNLL entities. Further more, we cre-
ate four binary features NE-PER, NE-LOC, NE-

As four types of CoNLL named entities are not
enough to cover 50 question types, we include the
101 dictionary files compiled in the Ephyra project
(Schlaefer et al., 2007). These dictionary files con-
tain names for specific semantic types. For exam-
ple, the actor dictionary comprises a list of actor
names such as Tom Hanks and Kevin Spacey. For
each question, if the head word of such question
(see Section 3) matches the name of a dictionary
file, then each noun phrase in a candidate sentence
is looked up to check its presence in the dictio-
nary. If so, a binary DIC feature is created. For
example, for the question What rank did Chester

Nimitz reach, as there is a military rank dictionary
matches the head word rank, then all the noun
phrases in a candidate sentence are looked up in
the military rank dictionary. As a result, a sen-
tence contains word Admiral will result in the DIC
feature being activated, as such word is present in
the military rank dictionary.
Note that an implementation tip is to allow the
proximity match in the dictionary look up. Con-
sider the question What film introduced Jar Jar
Binks. As there is a match between the ques-
tion head word film and the dictionary named
film, each noun phrase in the candidate sentence
is checked. However, no dictionary entities have
been found from the candidate sentence Best plays
Jar Jar Binks, a floppy-eared, two-legged creature
in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Men-
ace, although there is movie entitled Star Wars
Episode I: The Phantom Menace in the dictionary.
Notice that Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom
Menace in the sentence and the dictionary entity
Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace do not
have exactly identical spelling. The use of prox-
imity look up which allows edit distance being less
than 10% error can resolve this.

There are so far no match for question types of
NUM (as shown in Table 1) including NUM:count
and NUM:date etc. These types of questions
seek the numerical answers such as the amount of
money and the duration of period. It is natural to
compile regular expression patterns to match such
entities. For example, for a NUM:money typed
question What is Rohm and Haass annual rev-
enue, we compile NUM:money regular expression
pattern which matches the strings of number fol-
lowed by a currency sign ($ and dollars etc). Such
pattern is able to identify 4 billion $ as a candidate
answer in the candidate sentence Rohm and Haas,
with 4 billion $ in annual sales... There are 13 pat-

\x0ction and a candidate sentence. We list all question
and sentence match patterns which are used in our
experiments as following:
when born feature 1 The question begins with when is/was
and follows by a person name and then follows by key
word born; The candidate sentence contains such per-
son name which follows by the pattern of (number -
number).
when born feature 2 The question begins with when is/was
and follows by a person name and then follows by key
word born; The candidate sentence contains such per-
son name, a NUM:date entity, and a key word born.
where born feature 1 The question begins with where
is/was and follows by a person name and then follows
by key word born; The candidate sentence contains
such person name, a NER LOC entity, and a key word
born.
when die feature 1 The question begins with when did and
follows by a person name and then follows by key word
die; The candidate sentence contains such person name
which follows by the pattern of (number - number).
when die feature 2 The question begins with when did and
follows by a person name and then follows by key
word die; The candidate sentence contains such person
name, a NUM:date entity, and a key word died.
how many feature The question begins with how many and
follows by a noun; The candidate sentence contains a
number and then follows by such noun.
cooccurrent Feature This feature takes two phrase argu-
ments, if the question contains the first phrase and the
candidate sentence contains the second, such feature
would be activated.
Note that the construction of specific features
require the access to aforementioned extracted
named entities. For example, the when born fea-
ture 2 pattern needs the information whether a
candidate sentence contains a NUM:date entity
and where born feature 1 pattern needs the in-
formation whether a candidate sentence contains
a NER LOC entity. Note also that the patterns of
when born feature and when die feature have
similar structure and thus can be simplified in im-
plementation. How many feature can be used
to identify the sentence Amtrak annually serves
about 21 million passengers for question How
many passengers does Amtrak serve annually. The
cooccurrent feature is the most general one. An
example of cooccurrent feature would take the
arguments of marry and husband, or marry and
wife. Such feature would be activated for ques-
tion Whom did Eileen Marie Collins marry and
candidate sentence ... were Collins husband,
Pat Youngs, an airline pilot... It is worth noting
that the two arguments are not necessarily differ-
ent. For example, they could be both established,
which makes such feature activated for question
When was the IFC established and candidate sen-
tence IFC was established in 1956 as a member of
the World Bank Group. The reason why we use the
cooccurrence of the word established is due to its
main verb role, which may carry more information
than other words.

5.5 Dependency validity features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99866008">
Like (Cui et al., 2004), we extract the dependency
path from the question word to the common word
(existing in both question and sentence), and the
path from candidate answer (such as CoNLL NE
and numerical entity) to the common word for
each pair of question and candidate sentence using
Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning,
2003; Marneffe et al., 2006). For example, for
question When did James Dean die and candidate
sentence In 1955, actor James Dean was killed in
a two-car collision near Cholame, Calif., we ex-
tract the pathes of When:advmod:nsubj:Dean and
1955:prep-in:nsubjpass:Dean for question and
sentence respectively, where advmod and nsubj
etc. are grammatical relations. We propose the
dependency validity feature (DEP) as following.
For all paired paths between a question and a can-
didate sentence, if at least one pair of path in which
all pairs of grammatical relations have been seen
in the training, then the DEP feature is set to be
true, false otherwise. That is, the true validity fea-
ture indicates that at least one pair of path between
the question and candidate sentence is possible to
be a true pair (ie, the candidate noun phrase in the
sentence path is the true answer).

\x0cthen apply key word search for each question and
retrieve the top 20 relevant sentences. We create
a feature represented data point using each pair of
question and candidate sentence and label it either
true or false depending on whether the sentence
can answer the given question or not. The labeling
is conducted by matching the gold factoid answer
pattern against the candidate sentence.
There are two extra steps performed for train-
ing set but not for test data. In order to construct
a high quality training set, we manually check the
correctness of the training data points and remove
the false positive ones which cannot support the
question although there is a match to gold answer.
In addition, in order to keep the training data well
balanced, we keep maximum four false data points
(question answer pair) for each question but no
limit over the true label data points. In doing so,
we use 1458 questions to compile 8712 training
data points and among them 1752 have true labels.

bels.
We use the training data to train a maximum
entropy model and use such model to rank test
data set. Compared with a classification task (such
as the question classifier), the ranking process re-
quires one extra step: For data points which share
the same question, the probabilities of being pre-
dicted as true label are used to rank the data points.
In align with the previous work, performance is
evaluated using mean reciprocal rank (MRR), top
1 prediction accuracy (top1) and top 5 prediction
accuracy (top5). For the test data set, 157 among
the 202 questions have correct answers found in
retrieved sentences. This leads to the upper bound
of MRR score being 77.8%.
To evaluate how the quality of question clas-
sifiers affects the question answering, we have
created three question classifiers: QC1, QC2
and QC3. The features which are used to train
these question classifiers and their performance
are shown in Table 5. Note that QC3 is the best
question classifier we obtained in Section 4.

The first experiment is to evaluate the individ-
ual contribution of various features derived using
three question classifiers. Table 6 shows the base-
line result and results using DIC, NE, NE-4, REG,
SPE, and DEP features. The baseline is the key
word search without the use of maximum entropy
model. As can be seen, the question classifiers
do not affect the DIC feature at all, as DIC fea-
ture does not depend on question classifiers. Bet-
ter question classifier boosts considerable gain for
NE, NE-4 and REG in their contribution to ques-
tion answering. For example, the best question
classifier QC3 outperforms the worst one (QC1)
by 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.0% MRR scores for NE,
NE-4 and REG respectively. However, it is sur-
prising that the MRR and top5 contribution of NE
and NE-4 decreases if QC1 is replaced by QC2, al-
though the top1 score results in performance gain
slightly. This unexpected results can be partially
explained as follows. For some questions, even
QC2 produces correct predictions, the errors of
NE and NE-4 features may cause over-confident
scores for certain candidate sentences. As SPE and
DEP are not directly dependent on question clas-
sifier, their individual contribution only changes
slightly or remains the same for different ques-
tion classifiers. If the best question classifier is
used, the most important features are SPE and
REG, which can individually boost the MRR score
over 54%, while the others result in less significant
gains.
We now incrementally use various features and
the results are show in Table 6 as well. As can
be seen, the more features and the better question
classifier are used, the higher performance the ME
model has. The inclusion of REG and SPE results
in significant boost for the performance. For ex-
ample, if the best question classifier QC3 is used,
the REG results in 6.9% and 8% gain for MRR
and top1 scores respectively. This is due to a large
portion of NUM type questions in test dataset. The
SPE feature contributes significantly to the per-
formance due to its high precision in answering
birth/death time/location questions. NE and NE-4
result in reasonable gains while DEP feature con-
tributes little. However, this does not mean that
DEP is not important, as once the model reaches a
high MRR score, it becomes hard to improve.
Table 6 clearly shows that the question type
classifier plays an essential role in a high perfor-

mance question answer system. Assume all the
features are used, the better question classifier sig-
nificantly boosts the overall performance. For ex-
ample, the best question classifier QC3 outper-
forms the worst QC1 by 4.9%, 6.5%, and 2.0%
for MRR, top1 and top5 scores respectively. Even
compared to a good question classifier QC2, the
gain of using QC3 is still 3.4%, 4.0% and 2.0%
for MRR, top1 and top5 scores respectively. One
can imagine that if a fine grained NER is available
(rather than the current four type coarse NER), the
potential gain is much significant.
The reason that the question classifier affects
the question answering performance is straightfor-
ward. As a upstream source, the incorrect classi-
fication of question type would confuse the down-
stream answer search process. For example, for
question What is Rohm and Haass annual rev-
enue, our best question classifier is able to clas-
sify it into the correct type of NUM:money and
thus would put $ 4 billion as a candidate answer.
However, the inferior question classifiers misclas-
sify it into HUM:ind type and thereby could not
return a correct answer. Figure 1 shows the indi-
vidual MRR scores for the 42 questions (among
the 202 test questions) which have different pre-
dicted question types using QC3 and QC2. For al-
most all test questions, the accurate question clas-
sifier QC3 achieves higher MRR scores compared
to QC2.

Each feature corresponds to a constraint on the model. Given a training set of (C, D), where C is a set of class labels and D is a set of feature represented data points, the maximal ent</context>

Head Word head word is defined as one single word specifying the object that the question seeks. For example the head word of What is a group of turkeys called, is turkeys. This is different to previous work including (Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005) which has suggested a contiguous span of words (a group of turkeys in this example). The single word definition effectively avoids the noisy information brought by non-head word of the span (group in this case). A syntactic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and the Collins rules (Collins, 1999) are modified to extract such head words. WordNet Hypernym WordNet hypernyms are extracted for the head word of a given question. The classic Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) is used to compute the most probable sense for a head word in the question context, and then the hypernyms are extracted based on that sense. The depth of hypernyms is set to 544 \x0csix with trial and error.3 Hypernyms features capture the general terms of extracted head word.

For example, they could be both established, which makes such feature activated for question When was the IFC established and candidate sentence IFC was established in 1956 as a member of the World Bank Group. The reason why we use the cooccurrence of the word established is due to its main verb role, which may carry more information than other words. 5.5 Dependency validity features Like (Cui et al., 2004), we extract the dependency path from the question word to the common word (existing in both question and sentence), and the path from candidate answer (such as CoNLL NE and numerical entity) to the common word for each pair of question and candidate sentence using Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003; Marneffe et al., 2006).

In this section, we evaluate how the quality of question classifiers affects the question answering performance. 6.1 Experiment setup We use TREC99-03 factoid questions for training and TREC04 factoid questions for testing.

It is worth noting that, most of the features we used in question answering rank model, depend on the question type information. For instance, if a question is classified as a type of sport, we then only care about whether there are sport entities existing in the candidate sentences. It is expected that a fine grained named entity recognizer (NER) should make good use of the accurate question type information. However, due to the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we employ the Stanford NER package (Finkel et al., 2005) which identifies only four types of named entities.

In particular, if the question is ABBR type, we tag CoNLL LOC, ORG and MISC entities as candidate answers; If the question is HUMAN type, we tag CoNLL PER and ORG entities; And if the question is LOC type, we tag CoNLL LOC and MISC entities. For other types of questions, we assume there is no candidate CoNLL NEs to tag. We create a binary feature NE to indicate the presence or absence of tagged CoNLL entities. Further more, we create four binary features NE-PER, NE-LOC, NEORG, and NE-</context>

The best 3 We performed 10 cross validation experiment over training data and tried various depths of 1, 3, 6, 9 and , with signifies that no depth constraint is imposed. accuracies achieved are 93.6% and 89.0% for 6 and 50 classes respectively.

In addition, Lesks word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm is adapted and the depth of hypernym feature is optimized. With further augment of other standard features such as unigrams, we can obtain accuracy of 89.0% using ME model for 50 fine classes over UIUC dataset. In addition to building an accurate question classifier, we investigate the contribution of this question classifier to a feature driven</context>

This is different to previous work including (Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005) which has suggested a contiguous span of words (a group of turkeys in this example). The single word definition effectively avoids the noisy information brought by non-head word of the span (group in this case). A syntactic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and the Collins rules (Collins, 1999) are modified to extract such head words. WordNet Hypernym WordNet hypernyms are extracted for the head word of a given question. The classic Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) is used to compute the most probable sense for a head word in the question context, and then the hypernyms are extracted based on that sense. The depth of hypernyms is set to 544 \x0csix with trial and error.3 Hypernyms features capture the general terms of extracted head word.

It attempts to answer the question posed in natural language by providing the answer phrase rather than the whole documents. An important step in question answering (QA) is to classify the question to the anticipated type of the answer. For example, the question of Who discovered x-rays should be classified into the type of human (individual). This information would narrow down the search space to identify the correct answer string. In addition, this information can suggest different strategies to search and verify a candidate answer. In fact, the combination of question classification and t</context>

For other types of questions, we assume there is no candidate CoNLL NEs to tag. We create a binary feature NE to indicate the presence or absence of tagged CoNLL entities. Further more, we create four binary features NE-PER, NE-LOC, NEORG, and NE-MISC to indicate the presence of tagged CoNLL PER, LOC, ORG and MISC entities. 5.2 Dictionary entities presence feature As four types of CoNLL named entities are not enough to cover 50 question types, we include the 101 dictionary files compiled in the Ephyra project (Schlaefer et al., 2007). These dictionary files contain names for specific semantic types. For example, the actor dictionary comprises a list of actor names such as Tom Hanks and Kevin Spacey. For each question, if the head word of such question (see Section 3) matches the name of a dictionary file, then each noun phrase in a candidate sentence is looked up to check its presence in the dictionary. If so, a binary DIC feature is created. For example, for the question What rank did Chester 7 Person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC).

For instance, the NE feature checks the presence or absence of CoNLL style named entities subject to the classified question type. In this section, we evaluate how the quality of question classifiers affects the question answering performance. 6.1 Experiment setup We use TREC99-03 factoid questions for training and TREC04 factoid questions for testing. To facilitate the comparison to others work (Cui et al., 2004; Shen and Klakow, 2006), we first retrieve all relevant documents which are compiled by Ken Litkowski8 to create training and test datasets. We 8 Available at http://trec.nist.gov/data/qa.html. 547 \x0cthen apply key word search for each question and retrieve the top 20 relevant sentences. We create a feature represented data point using each pair of question and candidate sentence and label it either true or false depending on whether the sentence can answer the given question or not. The labeling is conducted by matching the gold factoid answer pattern against the candidate sentence. There are two extra steps perf</context>
