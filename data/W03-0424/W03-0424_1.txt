Abstract
Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems need
to integrate a wide variety of information for
optimal performance. This paper demonstrates
that a maximum entropy tagger can effectively
encode such information and identify named
entities with very high accuracy. The tagger
uses features which can be obtained for a vari-
ety of languages and works effectively not only
for English, but also for other languages such
as German and Dutch.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition1
(NER) can be treated as a
tagging problem where each word in a sentence is as-
signed a label indicating whether it is part of a named
entity and the entity type. Thus methods used for part
of speech (POS) tagging and chunking can also be used
for NER. The papers from the CoNLL-2002 shared
task which used such methods (e.g. Malouf (2002),
Burger et al. (2002)) reported results significantly lower
than the best system (Carreras et al., 2002). However,
Zhou and Su (2002) have reported state of the art results
on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data using a HMM-based tagger.
Zhou and Su (2002) used a wide variety of features,
which suggests that the relatively poor performance of the
taggers used in CoNLL-2002 was largely due to the fea-
ture sets used rather than the machine learning method.
We demonstrate this to be the case by improving on the
best Dutch results from CoNLL-2002 using a maximum
entropy (ME) tagger. We report reasonable precision and
recall (84.9 F-score) for the CoNLL-2003 English test
data, and an F-score of 68.4 for the CoNLL-2003 Ger-
man test data.

We assume that NER involves assigning the correct label to
an entity as well as identifying its boundaries.
Incorporating a diverse set of overlapping features
in a HMM-based tagger is difficult and complicates the
smoothing typically used for such taggers. In contrast, a
ME tagger can easily deal with diverse, overlapping fea-
tures. We also use a Gaussian prior on the parameters for
effective smoothing over the large feature space.
2 The ME Tagger
The ME tagger is based on Ratnaparkhi (1996)s POS tag-
ger and is described in Curran and Clark (2003) . The
tagger uses models of the form:
p(y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp
n
X
i=1
ifi(x, y)
!
(1)
where y is the tag, x is the context and the fi(x, y) are
the features with associated weights i. The probability
of a tag sequence y1 . . . yn given a sentence w1 . . . wn is
approximated as follows:
p(y1 . . . yn|w1 . . . wn) 
n
Y
i=1
p(yi|xi) (2)
where xi is the context for word wi. The tagger uses
beam search to find the most probable sequence given the
sentence.
The features are binary valued functions which pair a
tag with various elements of the context; for example:
fj(x, y) =
\x1a
1 if word(x) = Moody & y = I-PER
0 otherwise
(3)
word(x) = Moody is an example of a contextual predi-
cate.
Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) is used to estimate
the values of the weights. The tagger uses a Gaussian
prior over the weights (Chen et al., 1999) which allows a
large number of rare, but informative, features to be used
without overfitting.
\x0cCondition Contextual predicate

3 The Data
We used three data sets: the English and German data
for the CoNLL-2003 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003) and the Dutch data for the CoNLL-
2002 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). Each word in
the data sets is annotated with a named entity tag plus POS
tag, and the words in the German and English data also
have a chunk tag. Our system does not currently exploit
the chunk tags.
There are 4 types of entities to be recognised: persons,
locations, organisations, and miscellaneous entities not
belonging to the other three classes. The 2002 data uses
the IOB-2 format in which a B-XXX tag indicates the first
word of an entity of type XXX and I-XXX is used for sub-
sequent words in an entity of type XXX. The tag O in-
dicates words outside of a named entity. The 2003 data
uses a variant of IOB-2, IOB-1, in which I-XXX is used
for all words in an entity, including the first word, unless
the first word separates contiguous entities of the same
type, in which case B-XXX is used.
4 The Feature Set
Table 1 lists the contextual predicates used in our base-
line system, which are based on those used in the
Curran and Clark (2003) CCG supertagger. The first set
of features apply to rare words, i.e. those which appear
less than 5 times in the training data. The first two kinds
of features encode prefixes and suffixes less than length 5,
and the remaining rare word features encode other mor-
phological characteristics. These features are important
for tagging unknown and rare words. The remaining fea-
tures are the word, POS tag, and NE tag history features,
using a window size of 2. Note that the NEi2NEi1
feature is a composite feature of both the previous and
previous-previous NE tags.
Condition Contextual predicate
freq(wi) < 5 wi contains period
wi contains punctuation
wi is only digits
wi is a number
wi is {upper,lower,title,mixed} case
wi is alphanumeric
length of wi
wi has only Roman numerals
wi is an initial (X.)
wi is an acronym (ABC, A.B.C.)
wi memory NE tag for wi
unigram tag of wi+1
unigram tag of wi+2
wi wi in a gazetteer
wi1 in a gazetteer
wi+1 in a gazetteer
wi wi not lowercase and flc > fuc
wi unigrams of word type
bigrams of word types
trigrams of word types
Table 2: Contextual predicates in final system
Table 2 lists the extra features used in our final
system. These features have been shown to be use-
ful in other NER systems. The additional ortho-
graphic features have proved useful in other systems,
for example Carreras et al. (2002), Borthwick (1999) and
Zhou and Su (2002). Some of the rows in Table 2 de-
scribe sets of contextual predicates. The wi is only digits
predicates apply to words consisting of all digits. They
encode the length of the digit string with separate pred-
icates for lengths 14 and a single predicate for lengths
greater than 4. Titlecase applies to words with an ini-
tial uppercase letter followed by all lowercase (e.g. Mr).
Mixedcase applies to words with mixed lower- and up-
percase (e.g. CityBank). The length predicates encode
the number of characters in the word from 1 to 15, with a
single predicate for lengths greater than 15.
The next set of contextual predicates encode extra in-
formation about NE tags in the current context. The
memory NE tag predicate (see e.g. Malouf (2002))
records the NE tag that was most recently assigned to
the current word. The use of beam-search tagging
means that tags can only be recorded from previous
sentences. This memory is cleared at the beginning
of each document. The unigram predicates (see e.g.
Tsukamoto et al. (2002)) encode the most probable tag
for the next words in the window. The unigram probabil-
ities are relative frequencies obtained from the training
data. This feature enables us to know something about
the likely NE tag of the next word before reaching it.
\x0cMost systems use gazetteers to encode information
about personal and organisation names, locations and
trigger words. There is considerable variation in the size
of the gazetteers used. Some studies found that gazetteers
did not improve performance (e.g. Malouf (2002)) whilst
others gained significant improvement using gazetteers
and triggers (e.g. Carreras et al. (2002)). Our system in-
corporates only English and Dutch first name and last
name gazetteers as shown in Table 6. These gazetteers
are used for predicates applied to the current, previous
and next word in the window.
Collins (2002) includes a number of interesting con-
textual predicates for NER. One feature we have adapted
encodes whether the current word is more frequently seen
lowercase than uppercase in a large external corpus. This
feature is useful for disambiguating beginning of sen-
tence capitalisation and tagging sentences which are all
capitalised. The frequency counts have been obtained
from 1 billion words of English newspaper text collected
by Curran and Osborne (2002).
Collins (2002) also describes a mapping from words to
word types which groups words with similar orthographic
forms into classes. This involves mapping characters to
classes and merging adjacent characters of the same type.
For example, Moody becomes Aa, A.B.C. becomes
A.A.A. and 1,345.05 becomes 0,0.0. The classes
are used to define unigram, bigram and trigram contex-
tual predicates over the window.
We have also defined additional composite features
which are a combination of atomic features; for exam-
ple, a feature which is active for mid-sentence titlecase
words seen more frequently as lowercase than uppercase
in a large external corpus.
5 Results
The baseline development results for English using the
supertagger features only are given in Table 3. The full
system results for the English development data are given
in Table 7. Clearly the additional features have a signifi-
cant impact on both precision and recall scores across all
entities. We have found that the word type features are
particularly useful, as is the memory feature. The perfor-
mance of the final system drops by 1.97% if these fea-
tures are removed. The performance of the system if the
gazetteer features are removed is given in Table 4. The
sizes of our gazetteers are given in Table 6. We have
experimented with removing the other contextual pred-
icates but each time performance was reduced, except for
the next-next unigram tag feature which was switched off
for all final experiments.
The results for the Dutch test data are given in Table 5.
These improve upon the scores of the best performing
system at CoNLL-2002 (Carreras et al., 2002).

The final results for the English test data are given in
Table 7. These are significantly lower than the results for
the development data. The results for the German devel-
opment and test sets are given in Table 7. For the German
NER we removed the lowercase more frequent than up-
percase feature. Apart from this change, the system was
identical. We did not add any extra gazetteer information
for German.
6 Conclusion
Our NER system demonstrates that using a large variety
of features produces good performance. These features
can be defined and extracted in a language independent
manner, as our results for German, Dutch and English
show. Maximum entropy models are an effective way
of incorporating diverse and overlapping features. Our
maximum entropy tagger employs Gaussian smoothing
which allows a large number of sparse, but informative,
\x0cfeatures to be used without overfitting.
Using a wider context window than 2 words may im-
prove performance; a reranking phase using global fea-
tures may also improve performance (Collins, 2002).
