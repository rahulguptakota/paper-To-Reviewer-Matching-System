Abstract
This paper proposes a named entity recog-
nition (NER) method for speech recogni-
tion results that uses confidence on auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) as a fea-
ture. The ASR confidence feature indi-
cates whether each word has been cor-
rectly recognized. The NER model is
trained using ASR results with named en-
tity (NE) labels as well as the correspond-
ing transcriptions with NE labels. In ex-
periments using support vector machines
(SVMs) and speech data from Japanese
newspaper articles, the proposed method
outperformed a simple application of text-
based NER to ASR results in NER F-
measure by improving precision. These
results show that the proposed method is
effective in NER for noisy inputs.
1 Introduction
As network bandwidths and storage capacities
continue to grow, a large volume of speech data
including broadcast news and PodCasts is becom-
ing available. These data are important informa-
tion sources as well as such text data as newspaper
articles and WWW pages. Speech data as infor-
mation sources are attracting a great deal of inter-
est, such as DARPAs global autonomous language
exploitation (GALE) program. We also aim to use
them for information extraction (IE), question an-
swering, and indexing.
Named entity recognition (NER) is a key tech-
nique for IE and other natural language process-
ing tasks. Named entities (NEs) are the proper ex-
pressions for things such as peoples names, loca-
tions names, and dates, and NER identifies those
expressions and their categories. Unlike text data,
speech data introduce automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) error problems to NER. Although im-
provements to ASR are needed, developing a ro-
bust NER for noisy word sequences is also impor-
tant. In this paper, we focus on the NER of ASR
results and discuss the suppression of ASR error
problems in NER.
Most previous studies of the NER of speech
data used generative models such as hidden
Markov models (HMMs) (Miller et al., 1999;
Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001; Horlock and King,
2003b; Bechet et al., 2004; Favre et al., 2005).
On the other hand, in text-based NER, better re-
sults are obtained using discriminative schemes
such as maximum entropy (ME) models (Borth-
wick, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2003), support vec-
tor machines (SVMs) (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002),
and conditional random fields (CRFs) (McCal-
lum and Li, 2003). Zhai et al. (2004) applied a
text-level ME-based NER to ASR results. These
models have an advantage in utilizing various fea-
tures, such as part-of-speech information, charac-
ter types, and surrounding words, which may be
overlapped, while overlapping features are hard to
use in HMM-based models.
To deal with ASR error problems in NER,
Palmer and Ostendorf (2001) proposed an HMM-
based NER method that explicitly models ASR er-
rors using ASR confidence and rejects erroneous
word hypotheses in the ASR results. Such rejec-
tion is especially effective when ASR accuracy is
relatively low because many misrecognized words
may be extracted as NEs, which would decrease
NER precision.
Motivated by these issues, we extended their ap-
proach to discriminative models and propose an
NER method that deals with ASR errors as fea-
617
\x0ctures. We use NE-labeled ASR results for training
to incorporate the features into the NER model as
well as the corresponding transcriptions with NE
labels. In testing, ASR errors are identified by
ASR confidence scores and are used for the NER.
In experiments using SVM-based NER and speech
data from Japanese newspaper articles, the pro-
posed method increased the NER F-measure, es-
pecially in precision, compared to simply applying
text-based NER to the ASR results.
2 SVM-based NER
NER is a kind of chunking problem that can
be solved by classifying words into NE classes
that consist of name categories and such chunk-
ing states as PERSON-BEGIN (the beginning of
a persons name) and LOCATION-MIDDLE (the
middle of a locations name). Many discrimi-
native methods have been applied to NER, such
as decision trees (Sekine et al., 1998), ME mod-
els (Borthwick, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2003), and
CRFs (McCallum and Li, 2003). In this paper, we
employ an SVM-based NER method in the follow-
ing way that showed good NER performance in
Japanese (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).
We define three features for each word: the
word itself, its part-of-speech tag, and its charac-
ter type. We also use those features for the two
preceding and succeeding words for context de-
pendence and use 15 features when classifying a
word. Each feature is represented by a binary
value (1 or 0), for example, whether the previous
word is Japan, and each word is classified based
on a long binary vector where only 15 elements
are 1.
We have two problems when solving NER
using SVMs. One, SVMs can solve only a
two-class problem. We reduce multi-class prob-
lems of NER to a group of two-class problems
using the one-against-all approach, where each
SVM is trained to distinguish members of a
class (e.g., PERSON-BEGIN) from non-members
(PERSON-MIDDLE, MONEY-BEGIN, ... ). In this
approach, two or more classes may be assigned to
a word or no class may be assigned to a word. To
avoid these situations, we choose class c that has
the largest SVM output score gc(x) among all oth-
ers.
The other is that the NE label sequence must be
consistent; for example, ARTIFACT-END
must follow ARTIFACT-BEGIN or

ARTIFACT-MIDDLE. We use a Viterbi search to
obtain the best and consistent NE label sequence
after classifying all words in a sentence, based
on probability-like values obtained by applying
sigmoid function sn(x) = 1/(1 + exp(nx)) to
SVM output score gc(x).
3 Proposed method
3.1 Incorporating ASR confidence into NER
In the NER of ASR results, ASR errors cause NEs
to be missed and erroneous NEs to be recognized.
If one or more words constituting an NE are mis-
recognized, we cannot recognize the correct NE.
Even if all words constituting an NE are correctly
recognized, we may not recognize the correct NE
due to ASR errors on context words. To avoid
this problem, we model ASR errors using addi-
tional features that indicate whether each word is
correctly recognized. Our NER model is trained
using ASR results with a feature, where feature
values are obtained through alignment to the cor-
responding transcriptions. In testing, we estimate
feature values using ASR confidence scores. In
this paper, this feature is called the ASR confidence
feature.
Note that we only aim to identify NEs that are
correctly recognized by ASR, and NEs containing
ASR errors are not regarded as NEs. Utilizing er-
roneous NEs is a more difficult problem that is be-
yond the scope of this paper.
3.2 Training NER model
Figure 1 illustrates the procedure for preparing
training data from speech data. First, the speech
618
\x0cdata are manually transcribed and automatically
recognized by the ASR. Second, we label NEs
in the transcriptions and then set the ASR con-
fidence feature values to 1 because the words in
the transcriptions are regarded as correctly recog-
nized words. Finally, we align the ASR results to
the transcriptions to identify ASR errors for the
ASR confidence feature values and to label cor-
rectly recognized NEs in the ASR results. Note
that we label the NEs in the ASR results that exist
in the same positions as the transcriptions. If a part
of an NE is misrecognized, the NE is ignored, and
all words for the NE are labeled as non-NE words
(OTHER). Examples of text-based and ASR-based
training data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Since
the name Murayama Tomiichi in Table 1 is mis-
recognized in ASR, the correctly recognized word
Murayama is also labeled OTHER in Table 2. An-
other approach can be considered, where misrec-
ognized words are replaced by word error symbols
such as those shown in Table 3. In this case, those
words are rejected, and those part-of-speech and
character type features are not used in NER.
3.3 ASR confidence scoring for using the
proposed NER model
ASR confidence scoring is an important technique
in many ASR applications, and many methods
have been proposed including using word poste-
rior probabilities on word graphs (Wessel et al.,
2001), integrating several confidence measures us-
ing neural networks (Schaaf and Kemp, 1997),
using linear discriminant analysis (Kamppari and
Hazen, 2000), and using SVMs (Zhang and Rud-
nicky, 2001).
Word posterior probability is a commonly used
and effective ASR confidence measure. Word pos-
terior probability p([w; , t]|X) of word w at time
interval [, t] for speech signal X is calculated as
follows (Wessel et al., 2001):
p([w; , t]|X)
=
X
W W [w;,t]
n
p(X|W ) (p(W ))
o
p(X)

where W is a sentence hypothesis, W [w; , t] is
the set of sentence hypotheses that include w in

is a language model score,  is a scaling param-
eter (<1), and  is a language model weight.

In this paper, we use SVMs for ASR confidence
scoring to achieve a better performance than when
using word posterior probabilities as ASR confi-
dence scores. SVMs are trained using ASR re-
sults, whose errors are known through their align-
ment to their reference transcriptions. The follow-
ing features are used for confidence scoring: the
word itself, its part-of-speech tag, and its word
posterior probability; those of the two preceding
and succeeding words are also used. The word
itself and its part-of-speech are also represented
619
\x0cby a set of binary values, the same as with an
SVM-based NER. Since all other features are bi-
nary, we reduce real-valued word posterior prob-
ability p to ten binary features for simplicity: (if
0 < p  0.1, if 0.1 < p  0.2, ... , and if
0.9 < p  1.0). To normalize SVMs output
scores for ASR confidence, we use a sigmoid func-
tion sw(x) = 1/(1 + exp(wx)). We use these
normalized scores as ASR confidence scores. Al-
though a large variety of features have been pro-
posed in previous studies, we use only these sim-
ple features and reserve the other features for fur-
ther studies.
Using the ASR confidence scores, we estimate
whether each word is correctly recognized. If the
ASR confidence score of a word is greater than
threshold tw, the word is estimated as correct, and
we set the ASR confidence feature value to 1; oth-
erwise we set it to 0.
3.4 Rejection at the NER level
We use the ASR confidence feature to suppress
ASR error problems; however, even text-based
NERs sometimes make errors. NER performance
is a trade-off between missing correct NEs and
accepting erroneous NEs, and requirements dif-
fer by task. Although we can tune the parame-
ters in training SVMs to control the trade-off, it
seems very hard to find appropriate values for all
the SVMs. We use a simple NER-level rejection
by modifying the SVM output scores for the non-
NE class (OTHER). We add constant offset value to
to each SVM output score for OTHER. With a large
to, OTHER becomes more desirable than the other
NE classes, and many words are classified as non-
NE words and vice versa. Therefore, to works as a
parameter for NER-level rejection. This approach
can also be applied to text-based NER.
4 Experiments
We conducted the following experiments related
to the NER of speech data to investigate the per-
formance of the proposed method.
4.1 Setup
In the experiment, we simulated the procedure
shown in Figure 1 using speech data from the
NE-labeled text corpus. We used the training
data of the Information Retrieval and Extraction
Exercise (IREX) workshop (Sekine and Eriguchi,
2000) as the text corpus, which consisted of 1,174
Japanese newspaper articles (10,718 sentences)
and 18,200 NEs in eight categories (artifact, or-
ganization, location, person, date, time, money,
and percent). The sentences were read by 106
speakers (about 100 sentences per speaker), and
the recorded speech data were used for the exper-
iments. The experiments were conducted with 5-
fold cross validation, using 80% of the 1,174 ar-
ticles and the ASR results of the corresponding
speech data for training SVMs (both for ASR con-
fidence scoring and for NER) and the rest for the
test.
We tokenized the sentences into words and
tagged the part-of-speech information using the
Japanese morphological analyzer ChaSen 1 2.3.3
and then labeled the NEs. Unreadable to-
kens such as parentheses were removed in to-
kenization. After tokenization, the text cor-
pus had 264,388 words of 60 part-of-speech
types. Since three different kinds of charac-
ters are used in Japanese, the character types
used as features included: single-kanji
(words written in a single Chinese charac-
ter), all-kanji (longer words written in Chi-
nese characters), hiragana (words written
in hiragana Japanese phonograms), katakana
(words written in katakana Japanese phono-
grams), number, single-capital (words
with a single capitalized letter), all-capital,
capitalized (only the first letter is capital-
ized), roman (other roman character words), and
others (all other words). We used all the fea-
tures that appeared in each training set (no feature
selection was performed). The chunking states in-
cluded in the NE classes were: BEGIN (beginning
of a NE), MIDDLE (middle of a NE), END (ending
of a NE), and SINGLE (a single-word NE). There
were 33 NE classes (eight categories * four chunk-
ing states + OTHER), and therefore we trained 33
SVMs to distinguish words of a class from words
of other classes. For NER, we used an SVM-based
chunk annotator YamCha 2 0.33 with a quadratic
kernel (1 + ~
x  ~
y)2 and a soft margin parameter
of SVMs C=0.1 for training and applied sigmoid
function sn(x) with n=1.0 and Viterbi search to
the SVMs outputs. These parameters were exper-
imentally chosen using the test set.
We used an ASR engine (Hori et al., 2004) with
a speaker-independent acoustic model. The lan-

\x0cguage model was a word 3-gram model, trained
using other Japanese newspaper articles (about
340 M words) that were also tokenized using
ChaSen. The vocabulary size of the word 3-gram
model was 426,023. The test-set perplexity over
the text corpus was 76.928. The number of out-
of-vocabulary words was 1,551 (0.587%). 223
(1.23%) NEs in the text corpus contained such out-
of-vocabulary words, so those NEs could not be
correctly recognized by ASR. The scaling param-
eter  was set to 0.01, which showed the best ASR
error estimation results using word posterior prob-
abilities in the test set in terms of receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) curves. The language model
weight  was set to 15, which is a commonly used
value in our ASR system. The word accuracy ob-
tained using our ASR engine for the overall dataset
was 79.45%. In the ASR results, 82.00% of the
NEs in the text corpus remained. Figure 2 shows
the ROC curves of ASR error estimation for the
overall five cross-validation test sets, using SVM-
based ASR confidence scoring and word posterior
probabilities as ASR confidence scores, where
True positive rate
=
# correctly recognized words estimated as correct
# correctly recognized words
False positive rate
=
# misrecognized words estimated as correct
# misrecognized words
.
In SVM-based ASR confidence scoring, we used
the quadratic kernel and C=0.01. Parameter w of
sigmoid function sw(x) was set to 1.0. These pa-
rameters were also experimentally chosen. SVM-
based ASR confidence scoring showed better per-
formance in ASR error estimation than simple
word posterior probabilities by integrating mul-
tiple features. Five values of ASR confidence
threshold tw were tested in the following experi-
ments: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 (shown by black
dots in Figure 2).
4.2 Evaluation metrics
Evaluation was based on an averaged NER F-
measure, which is the harmonic mean of NER pre-
cision and recall:

A recognized NE was accepted as correct if and
only if it appeared in the same position as its refer-
ence NE through alignment, in addition to having
the correct NE surface and category, because the
same NEs might appear more than once. Compar-
isons of NE surfaces did not include differences
in word segmentation because of the segmentation
ambiguity in Japanese. Note that NER recall with
ASR results could not exceed the rate of the re-
maining NEs after ASR (about 82%) because NEs
containing ASR errors were always lost.
In addition, we also evaluated the NER perfor-
mance in NER precision and recall with NER-
level rejection using the procedure in Section 3.4,
by modifying the non-NE class scores using offset
value to.
4.3 Compared methods
We compared several combinations of features
and training conditions for evaluating the effect of
incorporating the ASR confidence feature and in-
vestigating differences among training data: text-
based, ASR-based, and both.
Baseline does not use the ASR confidence fea-
ture and is trained using text-based training data
only.
NoConf-A does not use the ASR confidence
feature and is trained using ASR-based training
data only.

(Unconfident words were rejected and replaced by word error symbols, tw = 0.4, ASR errors were
known.)
NoConf-TA does not use the ASR confidence
feature and is trained using both text-based and
ASR-based training data.
Conf-A uses the ASR confidence feature and is
trained using ASR-based training data only.
Proposed uses the ASR confidence feature and

training data.
Conf-Reject is almost the same as Proposed,
but misrecognized words are rejected and replaced
with word error symbols, as described at the end
of Section 3.2.
The following two methods are for reference.
Conf-UB assumes perfect ASR confidence scor-
ing, so the ASR errors in the test set are known.
The NER model, which is identical to Proposed,
is regarded as the upper-boundary of Proposed.
Transcription applies the same model as Base-
line to reference transcriptions, assuming word ac-
curacy is 100%.
4.4 NER Results
In the NER experiments, Proposed achieved the
best results among the above methods. Table
4 shows the NER results obtained by the meth-
ods without considering NER-level rejection (i.e.,
to = 0), using threshold tw = 0.4 for Conf-A,
Proposed, and Conf-Reject, which resulted in the
best NER F-measures (see Table 5). Proposed
showed the best F-measure, 69.02%. It outper-
formed Baseline by 2.0%, with a 7.5% improve-
ment in precision, instead of a recall decrease of
1.9%. Conf-Reject showed slightly worse results

5 Discussion
The proposed method effectively improves NER
performance, as shown by the difference between
Proposed and Baseline in Tables 4 and 5. Improve-
ment comes from two factors: using both text-
based and ASR-based training data and incorpo-
rating ASR confidence feature. As shown by the
difference between Baseline and the methods us-
ing ASR-based training data (NoConf-A, NoConf-
TA, Conf-A, Proposed, Conf-Reject), ASR-based
training data increases precision and decreases
recall. In ASR-based training data, all words
constituting NEs that contain ASR errors are re-
garded as non-NE words, and those NE exam-
ples are lost in training, which emphasizes NER
precision. When text-based training data are also
available, they compensate for the loss of NE
examples and recover NER recall, as shown by
the difference between the methods without text-
based training data (NoConf-A, Conf-A) and those
with (NoConf-TA, Proposed). The ASR confi-
dence feature also increases NER recall, as shown
by the difference between the methods without
it (NoConf-A, NoConf-TA) and with it (Conf-A,
Proposed). This suggests that the ASR confidence
feature helps distinguish whether ASR error influ-
ences NER and suppresses excessive rejection of
NEs around ASR errors.
With respect to the ASR confidence feature, the
small difference between Conf-Reject and Pro-
posed suggests that ASR confidence is a more
dominant feature in misrecognized words than the
other features: the word itself, its part-of-speech
tag, and its character type. In addition, the dif-
ference between Conf-UB and Proposed indicated
that there is room to improve NER performance
with better ASR confidence scoring.
NER-level rejection also increased precision, as
shown in Figure 3. We can control the trade-
off between precision and recall with to accord-
ing to the task requirements, even in text-based
NER. In the NER of speech data, we can ob-
tain much higher precision using both ASR-based
training data and NER-level rejection than using
either one.
6 Related work
Recent studies on the NER of speech data consider
more than 1-best ASR results in the form of N-best
lists and word lattices. Using many ASR hypothe-
ses helps recover the ASR errors of NE words in
1-best ASR results and improves NER accuracy.
Our method can be extended to multiple ASR hy-
potheses.
Generative NER models were used for multi-
pass ASR and NER searches using word lattices
(Horlock and King, 2003b; Bechet et al., 2004;
Favre et al., 2005). Horlock and King (2003a)
also proposed discriminative training of their NER
models. These studies showed the advantage of
using multiple ASR hypotheses, but they do not
use overlapping features.
Discriminative NER models were also applied
to multiple ASR hypotheses. Zhai et al. (2004) ap-
plied text-based NER to N-best ASR results, and
merged the N-best NER results by weighted vot-
ing based on several sentence-level results such as
ASR and NER scores. Using the ASR confidence
feature does not depend on SVMs and can be used
with their method and other discriminative mod-
els.
7 Conclusion
We proposed a method for NER of speech data
that incorporates ASR confidence as a feature
of discriminative NER, where the NER model
623
\x0cis trained using both text-based and ASR-based
training data. In experiments using SVMs,
the proposed method showed a higher NER F-
measure, especially in terms of improving pre-
cision, than simply applying text-based NER to
ASR results. The method effectively rejected erro-
neous NEs due to ASR errors with a small drop of
recall, thanks to both the ASR confidence feature
and ASR-based training data. NER-level rejection
also effectively increased precision.
Our approach can also be used in other tasks
in spoken language processing, and we expect it
to be effective. Since confidence itself is not lim-
ited to speech, our approach can also be applied to
other noisy inputs, such as optical character recog-
nition (OCR). For further improvement, we will
consider N-best ASR results or word lattices as in-
puts and introduce more speech-specific features
such as word durations and prosodic features.
