Abstract
This paper presents a statistical model which
trains from a corpus annotated with Part-Of-
Speech tags and assigns them to previously unseen
text with state-of-the-art accuracy(96.6%). The
model can be classified as a Maximum Entropy
model and simultaneously uses many contextual
"features" to predict the POS tag. Furthermore,
this paper demonstrates the use of specialized fea-
tures to model difficult tagging decisions, discusses
the corpus consistency problems discovered during
the implementation of these features, and proposes
a training strategy that mitigates these problems.
Introduction
Many natural language tasks require the accurate
assignment of Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags to pre-
viously unseen text. Due to the availability of
large corpora which have been manually annotated
with POS information, many taggers use anno-
tated text to "learn" either probability distribu-
tions or rules and use them to automatically assign
POS tags to unseen text.
The experiments in this paper were conducted
on the Wall Street Journal corpus from the Penn
Treebank project(Marcus et al., 1994), although
the model can trai~n from any large corpus anno-
tated with POS tags. Since most realistic natu-
ral language applications must process words that
were never seen before in training data, all exper-
iments in this paper are conducted on test data
that include unknown words.
Several recent papers(Brill, 1994,
Magerman, 1995) have reported 96.5% tag-
ging accuracy on the Wall St. Journal corpus.
The experiments in this paper test the hy-
pothesis that better use of context will improve
the accuracy. A Maximum Entropy model is
well-suited for such experiments since it corn-
bines diverse forms of contextual information
in a principled manner, and does not impose
any distributional assumptions on the train-
ing data. Previous uses of this model include
language modeling(Lau et al., 1993), machine
translation(Berger et al., 1996), prepositional
phrase attachment(Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994), and
word morphology(Della Pietra et al., 1995). This
paper briefly describes the maximum entropy
and maximum likelihood properties of the model,
features used for POS tagging, and the experi-
ments on the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal
corpus. It then discusses the consistency problems
discovered during an attempt to use specialized
features on the word context. Lastly, the results
in this paper are compared to those from previous
work on POS tagging.
The Probability Model
The probability model is defined over 7-/x 7-, where
7t is the set of possible word and tag contexts, or
"histories", and T is the set of allowable tags. The
model's probability of a history h together with a
tag t is defined as:
k
p(h,t) = Ill -J-
jj(h,t)
j=l
(1)
where ~" is a normalization constant,
{tt, ~1,..., ak} are the positive model parameters
and {fl,..-,fk} are known as "features", where
fj(h,t) E {O, 1}. Note that each parameter aj
corresponds to a feature fj.
Given a sequence of words {wl,..., Wn} and
tags {tl,...t,~} as training data, define hi as the
history available when predicting ti. The param-
eters {p, al ..... ak} are then chosen to maximize
133
the likelihood of the training data using p:
r(p) = 1-[ p(h.t,) = 1-[
i=1 i=1 j=l
This model also can be interpreted under the
Maximum Entropy formalism, in which the goal is
to maximize the entropy of a distribution subject
to certain constraints. Here, the entropy of the
distribution p is defined as:
H(p) = - E p(h,t) logp(h,t)
hE74,tET
and the constraints are given by:
Efj = Efj, l < j _<k (2)
where the model's feature expectation is
Efj= E p(h,t)fj(h,t)
hET.l,tET
and the observed feature expectation is
i=1
and where iS(hi, ti) denotes the observed probabil-
ity of (hi,ti) in the training data. Thus the con-
straints force the model to match its feature expec-
tations with those observed in the training data.
In practice, 7-/ is very large and the model's ex-
pectation Efj cannot be computed directly, so the
following approximation(Lau et al., 1993) is used:
n
E fj ,~ E15(hi)p(tilhi)fj(hi,ti)
i=1
where fi(hi) is the observed probability of the his-
tory hi in the training set.
It can be shown (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972)
that if p has the form (1) and satisfies the k
constraints (2), it uniquely maximizes the en-
tropy H(p) over distributions that satisfy (2), and
uniquely maximizes the likelihood L(p) over dis-
tributions of the form (1). The model parameters
for the distribution p are obtained via Generalized
Iterative Scaling(Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972).
Features for POS Tagging
The joint probability of a history h and tag t
is determined by those parameters whose corre-
sponding features are active, i.e., those o~j such
134
that fj(h,t) = 1. A feature, given (h,t), may ac-
tivate on any word or tag in the history h, and
must encode any information that might help pre-
dict t, such as the spelling of the current word, or
the identity of the previous two tags. The specific
word and tag context available to a feature is given
in the following definition of a history hi:
hi • {wi, wi+I, wi-}-2, wi-1, wi-2, ti-1, ti-2}
For example,
1 if suffix(w/) = "ing" & ti = VBG
fj(hl,ti)= 0 otherwise
If the above feature exists in the feature set of
the model, its corresponding model parameter will
contribute towards the joint probability p(hi,ti)
when wi ends with "±ng" and when ti =VBG1.
Thus a model parameter aj effectively serves as
a "weight" for a certain contextual predictor, in
this case the suffix "ing", towards the probability
of observing a certain tag, in this case a VBG.
The model generates the space of features by
scanning each pair (hi, ti) in the training data with
the feature "templates" given in Table 1. Given
hi as the current history, a feature always asks
some yes/no question about hi, and furthermore
constrains ti to be a certain tag. The instantia-
tions for the variables X, Y, and T in Table 1 are
obtained automatically from the training data.
The generation of features for tagging un-
known words relies on the hypothesized distinction
that "rare" words2 in the training set are similar
to unknown words in test data, with respect to
how their spellings help predict their tags. The
rare word features in Table 1, which look at the
word spellings, will apply to both rare words and
unknown words in test data.
For example, Table 2 contains an excerpt from
training data while Table 3 contains the features
generated while scanning (ha, t3), in which the cur-
rent word is about, and Table 4 contains features
generated while scanning (h4, t4), in which the cur-
rent word, well-heeled, occurs 3 times in train-
ing data and is therefore classified as "rare".
The behavior of a feature that occurs very
sparsely in the training set is often difficult to pre-
dict, since its statistics may not be reliable. There-
fore, the model uses the heuristic that any feature
1VBGis the Treebank POS tag for Verb Gerund.
2A "rare" word here denotes a word which occurs
less than 5 times in the training set. The count of 5
was chosen by subjective inspection of words in the
training data.

reliable, and ignores features whose counts are less
than 10.3 While there are many smoothing algo-
rithms which use techniques more rigorous than a
simple count cutoff, they have not yet been inves-
tigated in conjunction with this tagger.
Testing the Model
The test corpus is tagged one sentence at a time.
The testing procedure requires a search to enumer-
ate the candidate tag sequences for the sentence,
and the tag sequence with the highest probability
is chosen as the answer.
Search Algorithm
The search algorithm, essentially a "beam search",
uses the conditional tag probability
p(h,t)
p(tlh) - p(h,t')
and maintains, as it sees a new word, the N
highest probability tag sequence candidates up
to that point in the sentence. Given a sentence
a tag sequence candidate
has conditional probability:
P(tl . .tnlwl ..wn) = II p(tilh,)
i=l
In addition the search procedure optionally
consults a Tag Dictionary, which, for each known
word, lists the tags that it has appeared with in
the training set. If the Tag Dictionary is in effect,
the search procedure, for known words, generates
only tags given by the dictionary entry, while for
unknown words, generates all tags in the tag set.
Without the Tag Dictionary, the search procedure
generates all tags in the tag set for every word.
Let W = {wl...w,~} be a test sentence, and
let sij be the jth highest probability tag sequence
up to and including word wi. The search is de-
scribed below:
1. Generate tags for wl, find top N, set 81j, 1 _<
j < N, accordingly.
2. Initialize i = 2
(a) Initialize j = 1
3Except for features that look only at the cur-
rent word, i.e., features of the form wl ----<word>and
tl :<TAG>. The count of 10 was chosen by inspection
of Training and Development data.
136
(b) Generate tags for wi, given s(i-1)j as previous
tag context, and append each tag to s(i-1)j to
make a new sequence
(c) j = j + 1, Repeat from (b) ifj _< g
3. Find N highest probability sequences generated
by above loop, and set sij, 1 < j _<N, accord-
ingly.
4. i = i + 1, Repeat from (a) if i _< n
5. Return highest probability sequence, s~l
Experiments
In order to conduct tagging experiments, the
Wall St. Journal data has been split into three
contiguous sections, as shown in Table 5. The
feature set and search algorithm were tested and
debugged only on the Training and Development
sets, and the official test result on the unseen Test
set is presented in the conclusion of the paper.
The performances of the "baseline" model on the
Development Set, both with and without the Tag
Dictionary, are shown in Table 6.
All experiments use a beam size of N = 5;
further increasing the beam size does not signifi-
cantly increase performance on the Development
Set but adversely affects the speed of the tagger.
Even though use of the Tag Dictionary gave an ap-
parently insignificant (. 12%) improvement in accu-
racy, it is used in further experiments since it sig-
nificantly reduces the number of hypotheses and
thus speeds up the tagger.
The running time of the parameter estimation
algorithm is O(NTA), where N is the training set
size, T is the number of allowable tags, and A is
the average number of features that are active for a
given event (h, t). The running time of the search
procedure on a sentence of length N is O(NTAB),
where T, A are defined above, and B is the beam
size. In practice, the model for the experiment
shown in Table 6 requires approximately 24 hours
to train, and 1 hour to test 4 on an IBM RS/6000
Model 380 with 256MB of RAM.
Specialized Features and
Consistency
The Maximum Entropy model allows arbitrary
binary-valued features on the context, so it can use
additional specialized, i.e., word-specific, features
4The search procedure has not been optimized and
the author expects it to run 3 to 5 times faster after
optimizations.

Top Tagging Mistakes on Training Set for Baseline Model
137
to correctly tag the "residue" that the baseline
features cannot model. Since such features typ-
ically occur infrequently, the training set consis-
tency must be good enough to yield reliable statis-
tics. Otherwise the specialized features will model
noise and perform poorly on test data.
Such features can be designed for those words
which are especially problematic for the model.
The top errors of the model (over the training set)
are shown in Table 7; clearly, the model has trou-
ble with the words that and about, among others.
As hypothesized in the introduction, better fea-
tures on the context surrounding that and about
should correct the tagging mistakes for these two
words, assuming that the tagging errors are due to
an impoverished feature set, and not inconsistent
data.
Specialized features for a given word are con-
structed by conjoining certain features in the base-
line model with a question about the word itself.
The features which ask about previous tags and
surrounding words now additionally ask about the
identity of the current word, e.g., a specialized fea-
ture for the word about in Table 3 could be:
1 if wi : about ~ ti-2ti-1 = DT NNS
fj (hi, ti) = & ti = IN
0 otherwise
Table 8 shows the results of an experiment
in which specialized features are constructed for
"difficult" words, and are added to the baseline
feature set. Here, "difficult" words are those that
are mistagged a certain way at least 50 times when
the training set is tagged with the baseline model.
Using the set of 29 difficult words, the model per-
forms at 96.49% accuracy on the Development Set,
an insignificant improvement from the baseline ac-
curacy of 96.43%. Table 9 shows the change in er-
ror rates on the Development Set for the frequently
occurring "difficult" words. For most words, the
specialized model yields little or no improvement,
and for some, i.e., more and about, the specialized
model performs worse.
The lack of improvement implies that either
the feature set is still impoverished, or that the
training data is inconsistent. A simple consistency
test is to graph the POS tag assignments for a
given word as a function of the article in which
it occurs. Consistently tagged words should have
roughly the same tag distribution as the article
numbers vary. Figure 1 represents each POS tag
with a unique integer and graphs the POS annota-
tion of about in the training set as a function of the
138
articles (the points are "scattered" to show den-
sity). As seen in figure 1, about is usually anno-
tated with tag#l, which denotes IN (preposition),
or tag#9, which denotes RB (adverb), and the ob-
served probability of either choice depends heavily
on the current article-~. Upon further examina-
tion 5, the tagging distribution for about changes
precisely when the annotator changes. Figure 2,
which again uses integers to denote POS tags,
shows the tag distribution of about as a function of
annotator, and implies that the tagging errors for
this word are due mostly to inconsistent data. The
words ago, chief, down, executive, off, out, up
and yen also exhibit similar bias.
Thus specialized features may be less effective
for those words affected by inter-annotator bias.
A simple solution to eliminate inter-annotator in-
consistency is to train and test the model on data
that has been created by the same annotator. The
results of such an experiment 6 are shown in Ta-
ble 10. The total accuracy is higher, implying
that the singly-annotated training and test sets
are more consistent, and the improvement due to
the specialized features is higher than before (.1%)
but still modest, implying that either the features
need further improvement or that intra-annotator
inconsistencies exist in the corpus.
Comparison With Previous Work
Most of the recent corpus-based POS taggers in
the literature are either statistically based, and
use Markov Model(Weischedel et al., 1993,
Merialdo, 1994) or Statistical Decision
Tree(Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995)(SDT)
techniques, or are primarily rule based,
such as Drill's Transformation Based
Learner(Drill, 1994)(TBL). The Maximum
Entropy (MaxEnt) tagger presented in this paper
combines the advantages of all these methods. It
uses a rich feature representation, like TBL and
SDT, and generates a tag probability distribution
for each word, like Decision Tree and Markov
Model techniques.
5The mapping from article to annotator is in the
file doc/wsj .wht on the Treebank CDROM.
6The single-annotator training data was obtained
by extracting those articles tagged by "maryann" in
the Treebank v.5 CDROM. This training data does
not overlap with the Development and Test set used
in the paper. The single-annotator Development Set
is the portion of the Development Set which has also
been annotated by "maryann". The word vocabulary
and tag dictionary are the same as in the baseline
experiment.

Annotator
Figure 2: Distribution of Tags for the word "about" vs. Annotator
(Weischedel et al., 1993) provide the results
from a battery of "tri-tag" Markov Model exper-
iments, in which the probability P(W,T) of ob-
serving a word sequence W = {wl,w2,...,wn}
together with a tag sequence T = {tl,t2,...,tn}
is given by:
P(TIW)P(W) p(tl)p(t21tl) ×
H P(tilti-lti-2) p(wilti
i=3
Furthermore, p(wilti) for unknown words is com-
puted by the following heuristic, which uses a set
of 35 pre-determined endings:
p(wilti) p(unknownwordlti ) x
p(capitalfeature[ti) x
p(endings, hypenationlti )
This approximation works as well as the
MaxEnt model, giving 85% unknown word
accuracy(Weischedel et al., 1993) on the Wall St.
Journal, but cannot be generalized to handle more
diverse information sources. Multiplying together
all the probabilities becomes less convincing of
an approximation as the information sources be-
come less independent. In contrast, the Max-
Ent model combines diverse and non-local infor-
mation sources without making any independence
assumptions.
140
A POS tagger is one component in the
SDT based statisticM parsing system described
in (Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995). The
total word accuracy on Wall St. Jour-
nal data, 96.5%(Magerman, 1995), is similar to
that presented in this paper. However, the
aforementioned SDT techniques require word
classes(Brown et al., 1992) to help prevent data
fragmentation, and a sophisticated smoothing al-
gorithm to mitigate the effects of any fragmenta-
tion that occurs. Unlike SDT, the MaxEnt train-
ing procedure does not recursively split the data,
and hence does not suffer from unreliable counts
due to data fragmentation. As a result, no word
classes are required and a trivial count cutoff suf-
rices as a smoothing procedure in order to achieve
roughly the same level of accuracy.
TBL is a non-statistical approach to POS
tagging which also uses a rich feature repre-
sentation, and performs at a total word accu-
racy of 96.5% and an unknown word accuracy of
85%.(Bri11, 1994). The TBL representation of the
surrounding word context is almost the same 7 and
the TBL representation of unknown words is a
superset s of the unknown word representation in
this paper. However, since TBL is non-statistical,
it does not provide probability distributions and
7(Brill, 1994) looks at words ±3 away from the cur-
rent, whereas the feature set in this paper uses a win-
dow of ±2.
8(Brill, 1994) uses prefix/suffix additions and dele-
tions, which are not used in this paper.
!
unlike MaxEnt, cannot be used as a probabilis-
tic component in a larger model. MaxEnt can
provide a probability for each tagging decision,
which can be used in the probability calculation
of any structure that is predicted over the POS
tags, such as noun phrases, or entire parse trees,
as in (Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995).
Thus MaxEnt has at least one advantage over
each of the reviewed POS tagging techniques. It is
better able to use diverse information than Markov
Models, requires less supporting techniques than
SDT, and unlike TBL, can be used in a prob-
abilistic framework. However, the POS tagging
accuracy on the Penn Wall St. Journal corpus
is roughly the same for all these modelling tech-
niques. The convergence of the accuracy rate
implies that either all these techniques are miss-
ing the right predictors in their representation
to get the "residue", or more likely, that any
corpus based algorithm on the Penn Treebank
Wall St. Journal corpus will not perform much
higher than 96.5% due to consistency problems.
Conclusion
The Maximum Entropy model is an extremely
flexible technique for linguistic modelling, since it
can use a virtually unrestricted and rich feature
set in the framework of a probability model. The
implementation in this paper is a state-of-the-art
POS tagger, as evidenced by the 96.6% accuracy
on the unseen Test set, shown in Table 11.
The model with specialized features does not
perform much better than the baseline model, and
further discovery or refinement of word-based fea-
tures is difficult given the inconsistencies in the
training data. A model trained and tested on data
from a single annotator performs at .5% higher
accuracy than the baseline model and should pro-
duce more consistent input for applications that
require tagged text.
