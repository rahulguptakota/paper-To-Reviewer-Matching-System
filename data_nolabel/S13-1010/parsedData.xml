We describe a number of techniques for auto-
matically deriving lists of common and proper
nouns, and show that the distinction between
the two can be made automatically using a
vector space model learning algorithm. We
present a direct evaluation on the British Na-
tional Corpus, and application based evalua-
tions on Twitter messages and on automatic
speech recognition (where the system could be
employed to restore case).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979896">
Some nouns are homographs (they have the same
written form, but different meaning) which can be
used to denote either a common or proper noun, for
example the word apple in the following examples:
(1) Apple designs and creates iPod (2) The Apple II
series is a set of 8-bit home computers (3) The apple
is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree (4) For apple
enthusiasts tasting notes and apple identification.
The common and proper uses are not always as
clearly distinct as in this example; for example, a
specific instance of a common noun, e.g., District
Court turns court into a proper noun.
While heuristically, proper nouns often start with
a capital letter in English, capitalization can be in-
consistent, incorrect or omitted, and the presence or
absence of an article cannot be relied on.
The problem of distinguishing between common
and proper usages of nouns has not received much
attention within language processing, despite being
an important component for many tasks including
machine translation (Lopez, 2008; Hermjakob et al.,
2008), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Wil-
son et al., 2009) and topic tracking (Petrovic et al.,
2010). Approaches to the problem also have appli-
cations to tasks such as web search (Chen et al.,
1998; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 2011), and
case restoration (e.g., in automatic speech recogni-
tion output) (Baldwin et al., 2009), but frequently
involve the manual creation of a gazeteer (a list of
proper nouns), which suffer not only from omissions
but also often do not allow the listed words to as-
sume their common role in text.
This paper presents methods for generating lists
of nouns that have both common and proper usages
(Section 2) and methods for identifying the type of
usage (Section 3) which are evaluated using data de-
rived automatically from the BNC (Section 4) and
on two applications (Section 5). It shows that it is
difficult to automatically construct lists of ambigu-
ous nouns but also that they can be distinguished ef-
fectively using standard features from Word Sense
Disambiguation.

2 Generating Lists of Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989208363636364">
To our knowledge, no comprehensive list of com-
mon nouns with proper noun usage is available. We
develop a number of heuristics to generate such lists
automatically.
Part of speech tags A number of part of speech
(PoS) taggers assign different tags to common and
proper nouns. Ambiguous nouns are identified by
tagging a corpus and extracting those that have
had both tags assigned, together with the frequency
of occurrence of the common/proper usage. The
CLAWS (Garside, 1987) and the RASP taggers

\x0c(Briscoe et al., 2006) were applied to the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992) to generate the
lists BNCclaws and BNCrasp respectively. In addi-
tion the RASP tagger was also run over the 1.75 bil-
lion word Gigaword corpus (Graff, 2003) to extract
the list Gigaword.
Capitalization Nouns appearing intra-
sententially with both lower and upper case
first letters are assumed to be ambiguous. This
technique is applied to the 5-grams from the Google
corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) and the BNC
(creating the lists 5-grams and BNCcaps).
Wikipedia includes disambiguation pages for
ambiguous words which provide information about
their potential usage. Wikipedia pages for nouns
with senses (according to the disambiguation page)
in a set of predefined categories were identified to
form the list Wikipedia.
Named entity recognition The Stanford Named
Entity Recogniser (Finkel et al., 2005) was run over
the BNC and any nouns that occur in the corpus with
both named entity and non-named entity tags are ex-
tracted to form the list Stanford.
WordNet The final heuristic makes use of Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) which lists nouns that are of-
ten used as proper nouns with capitalisation. Nouns
which appeared in both a capitalized and lowercased
form were extracted to create the list WordNet.
Table 1 shows the number of nouns identified by
each technique in the column labeled words which
demonstrates that the number of nouns identified
varies significantly depending upon which heuris-
tic is used. A pairwise score is also shown to in-
dicate the consistency between each list and two ex-
ample lists, BNCclaws and Gigaword. It can be seen
that the level of overlap is quite low and the various
heuristics generate quite different lists of nouns. In
particular the recall is low, in almost all cases less
than a third of nouns in one list appear in the other.
One possible reason for the low overlap between
the noun lists is mistakes by the heuristics used to
extract them. For example, if a PoS tagger mistak-
enly tags just one instance of a common noun as
proper then that noun will be added to the list ex-
tracted by the part of speech heuristic. Two filter-
ing schemes were applied to improve the accuracy of
the lists: (1) minimum frequency of occurrence, the
noun must appear more than a set number of times

Precision (against BNCclaws) increased as the fil-
ters become more aggressive. However comparison
with Gigaword does not show such high precision
and recall is extremely low in all cases.
These experiments demonstrate that it is difficult
to automatically generate a list of nouns that exhibit
both common and proper usages. Manual analy-
sis of the lists generated suggest that the heuristics
can identify ambiguous nouns but intersecting the
lists results in the loss of some obviously ambigu-
ous nouns (however, their union introduces a large
amount of noise). We select nouns from the lists
created by these heuristics (such that the distribu-

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998332333333333">
We cast the problem of distinguishing between com-
mon and proper usages of nouns as a classification
task and develop the following approaches.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99617">
3.1 Most frequent usage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999009">
A naive baseline is supplied by assigning each word
its most frequent usage form (common or proper
noun). The most frequent usage is derived from the
training portion of labeled data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977582">
3.2 n-gram system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995528">
A system based on n-grams was implemented using
NLTK (Bird et al., 2009). Five-grams, four-grams,
trigrams and bigrams from the training corpus are
matched against a test corpus sentence, and results
of each match are summed to yield a preferred use in
the given context with a higher weight (experimen-
tally determined) being assigned to longer n-grams.
The system backs off to the most frequent usage (as
derived from the training data).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998805">
3.3 Vector Space Model (VSM)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998719642857143">
Distinguishing between common and proper nouns
can be viewed as a classification problem. Treating
the problem in this manner is reminiscent of tech-
niques commonly employed in Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD). Our supervised approach is based
on an existing WSD system (Agirre and Martinez,
2004) that uses a wide range of features:
Word form, lemma or PoS bigrams and tri-
grams containing the target word.
Preceding or following lemma (or word form)
content word appearing in the same sentence as
the target word.
High-likelihood, salient, bigrams.
Lemmas of all content words in the same sen-
tence as the target word.
Lemmas of all content words within a 4 word
window of the target word.
Non stopword lemmas which appear more than
twice throughout the corpus.
Each occurrence of a common / proper noun is
represented as a binary vector in which each position
indicates the presence or absence of a feature. A
centroid vector is created during the training phase
for the common noun and the proper noun instances
of a word. During the test phase, the centroids are
compared to the vector of each test instance using
the cosine metric, and the word is assigned the type
of the closest centroid.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999625967741935">
The approaches described in the previous section are
evaluated on two data sets extracted automatically
from the BNC. The BNC-PoS data set is created
using the output from the CLAWS tagger. Nouns
assigned the tag NP0 are treated as proper nouns
and those assigned any other nominal tag as com-
mon nouns. (According to the BNC manual the
NP0 tag has a precision 83.99% and recall 97.76%.2)
This data set consists of all sentences in the BNC in
which the target word appears. The second data set,
BNC-Capital, is created using capitalisation infor-
mation and consists of instances of the target noun
that do not appear sentence-initially. Any instances
that are capitalised are treated as proper nouns and
those which are non-capitalised as common nouns.
Experiments were carried out using capitalised
and decapitalized versions of the two test corpora.
The decapitalised versions by lowercasing each cor-
pus and using it for training and testing. Results are
presented in Table 3. Ten fold cross validation is
used for all experiments: i.e. 9/10th of the corpus
were used to acquire the training data centroids and
1/10th was used for evaluation. The average perfor-
mance over the 10 experiments is reported.
The vector space model (VSM) outperforms other
approaches on both corpora. Performance is partic-
ularly high when capitalisation is included (VSM w
caps). However, this approach still outperforms the
baseline without case information (VSM w/o caps),
demonstrating that using this simple approach is less
effective than making use of local context.

We also carried out experiments on two types of

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970813">
5.1 Twitter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.915987884615385">
As demonstrated in the BNC based evaluations, the
system can be applied to text which does not contain
capitalization information to identify proper nouns
(and, as a side effect, enable the correction of capi-
talization). An example of such a dataset are the (up
to) 140 character messages posted on Twitter.
There are some interesting observations to be
made on messages downloaded from Twitter. Al-
though some users choose to always tweet in lower
case, the overall distribution of capitalization in
tweets is high for the 100 words selected in Section 2
and only 3.7% of the downloaded tweets are entirely
lower case. It also appeared that users who capital-
ize, do so fairly consistently.
This allows the creation of a dataset based on
downloaded Twitter data3:
1. Identify purely lower case tweets containing
the target word. These will form the test data
(and are manually assigned usage).
2. Any non-sentence initial occurrences of the tar-
get word are used as training instances: lower
case indicating a common instance, upper case
indicating a proper instance.
14 words4 were randomly selected from the list
used in Section 4 and their lowercase tweet instances
were manually annotated by a single annotator. The

was 59%.
The results for the three systems are presented in
Table 4. As the length of the average sentence in the
Twitter data is only 15 words (compared to 27 words
in the BNCclaws data for the same target words),
the Twitter data is likely to be suffering sparseness
issues. This hypothesis is partly supported by the in-
crease in performance when the BNCclaws decapi-
talized data is added to the training data, however,
the performance of the n-gram system remains be-
low the most frequent use. On closer examination,
this is likely due to the skew in the data there are
many more examples for the common use of each
noun, and thus each context is much more likely to
have been seen in this setting.

5.2 Automatic speech recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999276565217391">
Most automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems
do not provide capitalization. However, our sys-
tem does not rely on capitalization information, and
therefore can identify proper / common nouns even
if capitalization is absent. Also, once proper nouns
are identified, the system can be used to restore case
a feature which allows an evaluation to take place
on this dataset. We use the TDT2 Test and Speech
corpus (Cieri et al., 1999), which contains ASR and
a manually transcribed version of news texts from
six different sources, to demonstrate the usefulness
of this system for this task.
The ASR corpus is restricted to those segments
which contain an equal number of target word oc-
currences in the ASR text and the manually tran-
scribed version, and all such segments are extracted.
The gold standard, and the most frequent usage, are
drawn from the manually transcribed data.
Again, results are based on an average perfor-
mance obtained using a ten fold cross validation.
Three versions of training data are used: the 9/10 of
ASR data (with labels provided by the manual tran-
scription), the equivalent 9/10 of lowercased manu-

The results can be seen in Table 5. The perfor-
mance rise obtained with the VSM model when the
ASR data is used is likely due to the repeated errors
within this, which will not be appearing in the man-
ually transcribed texts. The n-gram performance is
greatly affected by the low volume of training data
available, and again, a large skew within this.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998350181818182">
We automatically generate lists of common and
proper nouns using a number of different techniques.
A vector space model technique for distinguish-
ing common and proper nouns is found to achieve
high performance when evaluated on the BNC. This
greatly outperforms a simple n-gram based system,
due to its better adaptability to sparse training data.
Two application based evaluations also demonstrate
the systems performance and as a side effect the
system could serve as a technique for automatic case
restoration.
