<bodyText confidence="0.999095652173913">
A desirable quality of a coreference resolution
system is the ability to handle transitivity con-
straints, such that even if it places high like-
lihood on a particular mention being corefer-
ent with each of two other mentions, it will
also consider the likelihood of those two men-
tions being coreferent when making a final as-
signment. This is exactly the kind of con-
straint that integer linear programming (ILP)
is ideal for, but, surprisingly, previous work
applying ILP to coreference resolution has not
encoded this type of constraint. We train a
coreference classifier over pairs of mentions,
and show how to encode this type of constraint
on top of the probabilities output from our
pairwise classifier to extract the most probable
legal entity assignments. We present results
on two commonly used datasets which show
that enforcement of transitive closure consis-
tently improves performance, including im-
provements of up to 3.6% using the b3
scorer,
and up to 16.5% using cluster f-measure.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999527811320755">
Much recent work on coreference resolution, which
is the task of deciding which noun phrases, or men-
tions, in a document refer to the same real world
entity, builds on Soon et al. (2001). They built a
decision tree classifier to label pairs of mentions as
coreferent or not. Using their classifier, they would
build up coreference chains, where each mention
was linked up with the most recent previous men-
tion that the classifier labeled as coreferent, if such
a mention existed. Transitive closure in this model
was done implicitly. If John Smith was labeled
coreferent with Smith, and Smith with Jane Smith,
then John Smith and Jane Smith were also corefer-
ent regardless of the classifiers evaluation of that
pair. Much work that followed improved upon this
strategy, by improving the features (Ng and Cardie,
2002b), the type of classifier (Denis and Baldridge,
2007), and changing mention links to be to the most
likely antecedent rather than the most recent posi-
tively labeled antecedent (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).
This line of work has largely ignored the implicit
transitivity of the decisions made, and can result in
unintuitive chains such as the Smith chain just de-
scribed, where each pairwise decision is sensible,
but the final result is not.
Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) highlight
the problem of determining whether or not common
noun phrases are anaphoric. They use two clas-
sifiers, an anaphoricity classifier, which decides if
a mention should have an antecedent and a pair-
wise classifier similar those just discussed, which
are combined in a cascaded manner. More recently,
Denis and Baldridge (2007) utilized an integer lin-
ear programming (ILP) solver to better combine the
decisions made by these two complementary clas-
sifiers, by finding the globally optimal solution ac-
cording to both classifiers. However, when encoding
constraints into their ILP solver, they did not enforce
transitivity.
The goal of the present work is simply to show
that transitivity constraints are a useful source of
information, which can and should be incorporated
into an ILP-based coreference system. For this goal,
we put aside the anaphoricity classifier and focus
on the pairwise classifier and transitivity constraints.
We build a pairwise logistic classifier, trained on all
pairs of mentions, and then at test time we use an
ILP solver equipped with transitivity constraints to
find the most likely legal assignment to the variables
which represent the pairwise decisions.1 Our re-
sults show a significant improvement compared to
the nave use of the pairwise classifier.

For this task we are given a document which is an-
notated with a set of mentions, and the goal is to
cluster the mentions which refer to the same entity.
When describing our model, we build upon the no-
tation used by Denis and Baldridge (2007).

2.1 Pairwise Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999421333333333">
Our baseline systems are based on a logistic classi-
fier over pairs of mentions. The probability of a pair
of mentions takes the standard logistic form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9994726">
P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; ) =
\x10

where mi and mj correspond to mentions i and j
respectively; f(mi, mj) is a feature function over a
pair of mentions; are the feature weights we wish
to learn; and xhi,ji is a boolean variable which takes
value 1 if mi and mj are coreferent, and 0 if they are
not. The log likelihood of a document is the sum of
the log likelihoods of all pairs of mentions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9724365">
L(x|m; ) =

log P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.950376666666667">

where m is the set of mentions in the document, and
x is the set of variables representing each pairwise
coreference decision xhi,ji. Note that this model is
degenerate, because it assigns probability mass to
nonsensical clusterings. Specifically, it will allow

<bodyText confidence="0.996895379310345">
Prior work (Soon et al., 2001; Denis and
Baldridge, 2007) has generated training data for
pairwise classifiers in the following manner. For
each mention, work backwards through the preced-
ing mentions in the document until you come to a
true coreferent mention. Create negative examples
for all intermediate mentions, and a positive exam-
ple for the mention and its correct antecedent. This
approach made sense for Soon et al. (2001) because
testing proceeded in a similar manner: for each men-
tion, work backwards until you find a previous men-
tion which the classifier thinks is coreferent, add
a link, and terminate the search. The COREF-ILP
model of Denis and Baldridge (2007) took a dif-
ferent approach at test time: for each mention they
would work backwards and add a link for all pre-
vious mentions which the classifier deemed coref-
erent. This is equivalent to finding the most likely
assignment to each xhi,ji in Equation 2. As noted,
these assignments may not be a legal clustering be-
cause there is no guarantee of transitivity. The tran-
sitive closure happens in an ad-hoc manner after
this assignment is found: any two mentions linked
through other mentions are determined to be coref-
erent. Our SOON-STYLE baseline used the same
training and testing regimen as Soon et al. (2001).
Our D&amp;B-STYLE baseline used the same test time
method as Denis and Baldridge (2007), however at
training time we created data for all mention pairs.

2.2 Integer Linear Programming to Enforce
Transitivity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998703714285714">
Because of the ad-hoc manner in which transitiv-
ity is enforced in our baseline systems, we do not
necessarily find the most probable legal clustering.
This is exactly the kind of task at which integer
linear programming excels. We need to first for-
mulate the objective function which we wish the
ILP solver to maximize at test time.2 Let phi,ji =
log P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; ), which is the log probabil-
ity that mi and mj are coreferent according to the
pairwise logistic classifier discussed in the previous
section, and let phi,ji = log(1 phi,ji), be the log
probability that they are not coreferent. Our objec-
tive function is then the log probability of a particu-
lar (possibly illegal) variable assignment:

max
X
mi,mjm2
phi,ji xhi,ji phi,ji (1xhi,ji) (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982773">
We add binary constraints on each of the variables:
xhi,ji {0, 1}. We also add constraints, over each
triple of mentions, to enforce transitivity:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999254">
(1 xhi,ji) + (1 xhj,ki) (1 xhi,ki) (4)

xhj,ki = 1 it must also be the case that xhi,ki = 1.

3 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995540708333333">
We used lp solve3 to solve our ILP optimization
problems. We ran experiments on two datasets. We
used the MUC-6 formal training and test data, as
well as the NWIRE and BNEWS portions of the ACE
(Phase 2) corpus. This corpus had a third portion,
NPAPER, but we found that several documents where
too long for lp solve to find a solution.4
We added named entity (NE) tags to the data us-
ing the tagger of Finkel et al. (2005). The ACE data
is already annotated with NE tags, so when they con-
flicted they overrode the tags output by the tagger.
We also added part of speech (POS) tags to the data
using the tagger of Toutanova et al. (2003), and used
the tags to decide if mentions were plural or sin-
gular. The ACE data is labeled with mention type
(pronominal, nominal, and name), but the MUC-
6 data is not, so the POS and NE tags were used
to infer this information. Our feature set was sim-
ple, and included many features from (Soon et al.,
2001), including the pronoun, string match, definite
and demonstrative NP, number and gender agree-
ment, proper name and appositive features. We had
additional features for NE tags, head matching and
head substring matching.

3.1 Evaluation Metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986156833333333">
The MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) is a popular
coreference evaluation metric, but we found it to be
fatally flawed. As observed by Luo et al. (2004),
if all mentions in each document are placed into a
single entity, the results on the MUC-6 formal test
set are 100% recall, 78.9% precision, and 88.2%
F1 score significantly higher than any published
system. The b3 scorer (Amit and Baldwin, 1998)
was proposed to overcome several shortcomings of
the MUC scorer. However, coreference resolution
is a clustering task, and many cluster scorers al-
ready exist. In addition to the MUC and b3 scorers,

pairwise accuracy of the clustering; and variation

3.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999690055555556">
Our results are summarized in Table 1. We show
performance for both baseline classifiers, as well as
our ILP-based classifier, which finds the most prob-
able legal assignment to the variables representing
coreference decisions over pairs of mentions. For
comparison, we also give the results of the COREF-
ILP system of Denis and Baldridge (2007), which
was also based on a nave pairwise classifier. They
used an ILP solver to find an assignment for the vari-
ables, but as they note at the end of Section 5.1, it is
equivalent to taking all links for which the classifier
returns a probability 0.5, and so the ILP solver is
not really necessary. We also include their JOINT-
ILP numbers, however that system makes use of an
additional anaphoricity classifier.
For all three corpora, the ILP model beat both
baselines for the cluster f-score, Rand index, and
variation of information metrics. Using the b3 met-
ric, the ILP system and the D&amp;B-STYLE baseline
performed about the same on the MUC-6 corpus,
though for both ACE corpora, the ILP system was
the clear winner. When using the MUC scorer, the
ILP system always did worse than the D&amp;B-STYLE
baseline. However, this is precisely because the
transitivity constraints tend to yield smaller clusters
(which increase precision while decreasing recall).
Remember that going in the opposite direction and
simply putting all mentions in one cluster produces
a MUC score which is higher than any in the table,
even though this clustering is clearly not useful in
applications. Hence, we are skeptical of this mea-
sures utility and provide it primarily for compari-
son with previous work. The improvements from
the ILP system are most clearly shown on the ACE
NWIRE corpus, where the b3 f-score improved 3.6%,
and the cluster f-score improved 16.5%.

Using their classifier, they would build up coreference chains, where each mention was linked up with the most recent previous mention that the classifier labeled as coreferent, if such a mention existed. Transitive closure in this model was done implicitly. If John Smith was labeled coreferent with Smith, and Smith with Jane Smith, then John Smith and Jane Smith were also coreferent regardless of the classifiers evaluation of that pair. Much work that followed improved upon this strategy, by improving the features (Ng and Cardie, 2002b), the type of classifier (Denis and Baldridge, 2007), and changing mention links to be to the most likely antecedent rather than the most recent positively labeled antecedent (Ng and Cardie, 2002b). This line of work has largely ignored the implicit transitivity of the decisions made, and can result in unintuitive chains such as the Smith chain just described, where each pairwise decision is sensible, but the final result is not. Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) highlight the problem of determining whether or not common noun phrases are anaphoric.

When describing our model, we build upon the notation used by Denis and Baldridge (2007). 2.1 Pairwise Classification Our baseline systems are based on a logistic classifier over pairs of mentions. The probability of a pair of mentions takes the standard logistic form: P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; ) = \x10 1 + ef(mi,mj) \x111 (1) where mi and mj correspond to mentions i and j respectively; f(mi, mj) is a feature function over a pair of mentions; are the feature weights we wish to learn; and xhi,ji is a boolean variable which takes value 1 if mi and mj are coreferent, and 0 if they are not.

For each mention, work backwards through the preceding mentions in the document until you come to a true coreferent mention. Create negative examples for all intermediate mentions, and a positive example for the mention and its correct antecedent. This approach made sense for Soon et al. (2001) because testing proceeded in a similar manner: for each mention, work backwards until you find a previous mention which the classifier thinks is coreferent, add a link, and terminate the search. The COREF-ILP model of Denis and Baldridge (2007) took a different approach at test time: for each mention they would work backwards and add a link for all previous mentions which the classifier deemed coreferent. This is equivalent to finding the most likely assignment to each xhi,ji in Equation 2. As noted, these assignments may not be a legal clustering because there is no guarantee of transitivity. The transitive closure happens in an ad-hoc manner after this assignment is found: any two mentions linked through other mentions are determined to be coreferent.

They used an ILP solver to find an assignment for the variables, but as they note at the end of Section 5.1, it is equivalent to taking all links for which the classifier returns a probability 0.5, and so the ILP solver is not really necessary. We also include their JOINTILP numbers, however that system makes use of an additional anaphoricity classifier.

We present results on two commonly used datasets which show that enforcement of transitive closure consistently improves performance, including improvements of up to 3.6% using the b3 scorer, and up to 16.5% using cluster f-measure. 1 Introduction Much recent work on coreference resolution, which is the task of deciding which noun phrases, or mentions, in a document refer to the same real world entity, builds on Soon et al. (2001). They built a decision tree classifier to label pairs of mentions as coreferent or not. Using their classifier, they would build up coreference chains, where each mention was linked up with the most recent previous mention that the classifier labeled as coreferent, if such a mention existed. Transitive closure in this model was done implicitly. If John Smith was labeled coreferent with Smith, and Smith with Jane Smith, then John Smith and Jane Smith were also coreferent regardless of the classifiers evaluation of that pair.

The log likelihood of a document is the sum of the log likelihoods of all pairs of mentions: L(x|m; ) = X mi,mj m2 log P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; ) (2) where m is the set of mentions in the document, and x is the set of variables representing each pairwise coreference decision xhi,ji. Note that this model is degenerate, because it assigns probability mass to nonsensical clusterings. Specifically, it will allow xhi,ji = xhj,ki = 1 while xhi,ki = 0. Prior work (Soon et al., 2001; Denis and Baldridge, 2007) has generated training data for pairwise classifiers in the following manner. For each mention, work backwards through the preceding mentions in the document until you come to a true coreferent mention. Create negative examples for all intermediate mentions, and a positive example for the mention and its correct antecedent. This approach made sense for Soon et al. (2001) because testing proceeded in a similar manner: for each mention, work backwards until you find a previous mention which the classifier thinks is coreferent, add a link, and terminate the search.

This is equivalent to finding the most likely assignment to each xhi,ji in Equation 2. As noted, these assignments may not be a legal clustering because there is no guarantee of transitivity. The transitive closure happens in an ad-hoc manner after this assignment is found: any two mentions linked through other mentions are determined to be coreferent. Our SOON-STYLE baseline used the same training and testing regimen as Soon et al. (2001). Our D&amp;B-STYLE baseline used the same test time method as Denis and Baldridge (2007), however at training time we created data for all mention pairs. 2.2 Integer Linear Programming to Enforce Transitivity Because of the ad-hoc manner in which transitivity is enforced in our baseline systems, we do not necessarily find the most probable legal clustering. This is exactly the kind of task at which integer linear programming excels. We need to first formulate the objective function which we wish the ILP solver to maximize at test time.2 Let phi,ji = log P(xhi,ji|mi, mj; ), which is the log probab</context>

We used the MUC-6 formal training and test data, as well as the NWIRE and BNEWS portions of the ACE (Phase 2) corpus. This corpus had a third portion, NPAPER, but we found that several documents where too long for lp solve to find a solution.4 We added named entity (NE) tags to the data using the tagger of Finkel et al. (2005). The ACE data is already annotated with NE tags, so when they conflicted they overrode the tags output by the tagger. We also added part of speech (POS) tags to the data using the tagger of Toutanova et al. (2003), and used the tags to decide if mentions were plural or singular.

The b3 scorer (Amit and Baldwin, 1998) was proposed to overcome several shortcomings of the MUC scorer. However, coreference resolution is a clustering task, and many cluster scorers already exist. In addition to the MUC and b3 scorers, we also evaluate using cluster f-measu</context>
