1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996711513513514">
We present a novel approach for the problem of Named
Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC), in the
context of the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task.
Our work is framed into the learning and inference
paradigm for recognizing structures in Natural Language
(Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Carreras et al., 2002). We
make use of several learned functions which, applied
at local contexts, discriminatively select optimal partial
structures. On the top of this local recognition, an infer-
ence layer explores the partial structures and builds the
optimal global structure for the problem.
For the NERC problem, the structures to be recognized
are the named entity phrases (NE) of a sentence. First, we
apply learning at word level to identify NE candidates by
means of a Begin-Inside classification. Then, we make
use of functions learned at phrase level one for each
NE category to discriminate among competing NEs.
We propose a simple online learning algorithm for
training all the involved functions together. Each function
is modeled as a voted perceptron (Freund and Schapire,
1999). The learning strategy works online at sentence
level. When visiting a sentence, the functions being
learned are first used to recognize the NE phrases, and
then updated according to the correctness of their solu-
tion. We analyze the dependencies among the involved
perceptrons and a global solution in order to design a
global update rule based on the recognition of named-
entities, which reflects to each individual perceptron its
committed errors from a global perspective.
The learning approach presented here is closely re-
lated to and inspired by some recent works in the area
of NLP and Machine Learning. Collins (2002) adapted
the perceptron learning algorithm to tagging tasks, via
sentence-based global feedback. Crammer and Singer
(2003) presented an online topic-ranking algorithm in-
volving several perceptrons and ranking-based update
rules for training them.

2 Named-Entity Phrase Chunking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999105">
In this section we describe our NERC approach as a
phrase chunking problem. First we formalize the prob-
lem of NERC, then we propose a NE-Chunker.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990585">
2.1 Problem Formalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995179266666667">
Let x be a sentence belonging to the sentence space X,
formed by n words xi with i ranging from 0 to n1. Let
K be the set of NE categories, which in the CoNLL-2003
setting is K = {LOC, PER, ORG, MISC}.
A NE phrase, denoted as (s, e)k, is a phrase spanning
from word xs to word xe, having s e, with category
k K. Let NE be the set of all potential NE phrases,
expressed as NE = {(s, e)k  |0 s e, k K} .
We say that two different NE phrases ne1 = (s1, e1)k1
and ne2 = (s2, e2)k2
overlap, denoted as ne1 ne2 iff
e1 s2 e2 s1. A solution for the NERC problem
is a set y formed by NE phrases that do not overlap, also
known as a chunking. We define the set Y as the set of all
possible chunkings. Formally, it can be expressed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.888105">
Y = {y NE  |ne1, ne2 y ne16ne2}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975965">
The goal of the NE extraction problem is to identify
the correct solution y Y for a given sentence x.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973963">
2.2 NE-Chunker
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937084">
The NE-Chunker is a function which given a sentence
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.620108">
x X identifies the set of NE phrases y Y:
NEch : X Y
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995340666666667">
The NE-Chunker recognizes NE phrases in two lay-
ers of processing. In the first layer, a set of NE can-
didates for a sentence is identified, out of all the po-
tential phrases in NE. To do so, we apply learning at
word level in order to perform a Begin-Inside classifica-
tion. That is, we assume a function hB(w) which de-
cides whether a word w begins a NE phrase or not, and a
function hI(w) which decides whether a word is inside a
NE phrase or not. Furthermore, we define the predicate
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.693218" genericHeader="introduction">
BI
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950595">
, which tests whether a certain phrase is formed by
\x0ca starting begin word and subsequent inside words. For-
mally, BI
((s, e)k) = (hB(s) i : s &amp;lt; i e : hI(i)).
The recognition will only consider solutions formed by
phases in NE which satisfy the BI
predicate. Thus, this
layer is used to filter out candidates from NE and conse-
quently reduce the size of the solution space Y. Formally,
the solution space that is explored can be expressed as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5940845">
YBI = {y Y  |ney BI
(ne)}.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999020363636363">
The second layer selects the best coherent set of NE
phrases by applying learning at phrase level. We assume
a number of scoring functions, which given a NE phrase
produce a real-valued score indicating the plausibility of
the phrase. In particular, for each category k K we as-
sume a function scorek which produces a positive score if
the phrase is likely to belong to category k, and a negative
score otherwise.
Given this, the NE-Chunker is a function which
searches a NE chunking for a sentence x according to
the following optimality criterion:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9835832">
NEch(x) = arg max
yYBI
X
(s,e)ky
scorek(s, e)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974558">
That is, among the considered chunkings of the sen-
tence, the optimal one is defined to be the one whose
NE phrases maximize the summation of phrase scores.
Practically, there is no need to explicitly enumerate each
possible chunking in YBI . Instead, by using dynamic
programming the optimal chunking can be found in
quadratic time over the sentence length, performing a
Viterby-style exploration from left to right (Punyakanok
and Roth, 2001).
Summarizing, the NE-Chunker recognizes the set of
NE phrases of a sentence as follows: First, NE candidates
are identified in linear time, applying a linear number of
decisions. Then, the optimal coherent set of NE phrases
is selected in quadratic time, applying a quadratic number
of decisions.

3 Learning via Recognition Feedback
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935704461538461">
We now present an online learning strategy for training
the learning components of the NE-Chunker, namely the
functions hB and hI and the functions scorek, for k K.
Each function is implemented using a perceptron1
and
a representation function.
A perceptron is a linear discriminant function hw :
Rn
R parametrized by a weight vector w in Rn
.
Given an instance x Rn
, a perceptron outputs as
prediction the inner product between vectors x and w,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8974205">
hw(x) = w x.
1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516117647059">
Actually, we use a variant of the model called the voted
perceptron, explained below.
The representation function : X Rn
codifies an
instance x belonging to some space X into a vector in Rn
with which the perceptron can operate.
The functions hB and hI predict whether a word begins
or is inside a NE phrase, respectively. Each one consists
of a perceptron weight vector, wB and wI, and a shared
representation function w, explained in section 4. Each
function is computed as hl = wl w(x), for l {B, I},
and the sign is taken as the binary classification.
The functions scorek, for k K, compute a score for
a phrase (s, e) being a NE phrase of category k. For each
function there is a vector wk, and a shared representation
function p, also explained in section 4. The score is
given by the expression scorek(s, e) = wk p(s, e).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999443">
3.1 Learning Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997009">
We propose a mistake-driven online learning algorithm
for training the parameter vectors w of each perceptron all
in one go. The algorithm starts with all vectors initialized
to 0, and then runs repeatedly in a number of epochs T
through all the sentences in the training set. Given a sen-
tence, it predicts its optimal chunking as specified above
using the current vectors. If the predicted chunking is not
perfect the vectors which are responsible of the incorrect
predictions are updated additively.
The sentence-based learning algorithm is as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.523354363636364">
Input: {(x1
, y1
), . . . , (xm

Define: W = {wB, wI} {wk|k K}.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9685152">
Output: the vectors in W.
We now describe the learning feedback. Let y
be the
gold set of NE phrases for a sentence x, and y the set pre-
dicted by the NE-Chunker. Let goldB(i) and goldI(i) be
respectively the perfect indicator functions for the begin
and inside classifications, that is, they return 1 if word
xi begins or is inside some phrase in y
and 0 otherwise.
We differentiate three kinds of phrases in order to give
feedback to the functions being learned:
Phrases correctly identified: (s, e)k y
y:
Do nothing, since they are correct.
Missed phrases: (s, e)k y
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.858926">
\\ y:
1. Update begin word, if misclassified:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.888886888888889">
if (wB w(xs) 0) then
wB = wB + w(xs)
\x0c2. Update misclassified inside words:
i : s &amp;lt; i e : such that (wI w(xi) 0)
wI = wI + w(xi)
3. Update score function, if it has been applied:
if (wB w(xs) &gt; 0
i : s &amp;lt; i e : wI w(xi) &gt; 0) then
wk = wk + p(s, e)
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.612971">
Over-predicted phrases: (s, e)k y \\ y
:
1. Update score function:
wk = wk p(s, e)
2. Update begin word, if misclassified :
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.9700752">
if (goldB(s) = 0) then
wB = wB w(xs)
3. Update misclassified inside words :
i : s &amp;lt; i e : such that (goldI(i) = 0)
wI = wI w(xi)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921275">
This feedback models the interaction between the two
layers of the recognition process. The Begin-Inside iden-
tification filters out phrase candidates for the scoring
layer. Thus, misclassifying words of a correct phrase
blocks the generation of the candidate and produces a
missed phrase. Therefore, we move the begin or end
prediction vectors toward the misclassified words of a
missed phrase. When an incorrect phrase is predicted,
we move away the prediction vectors of the begin and in-
side words, provided that they are not in the beginning or
inside a phrase in the gold chunking. Note that we delib-
erately do not care about false positives begin or inside
words which do not finally over-produce a phrase.
Regarding the scoring layer, each category prediction
vector is moved toward missed phrases and moved away
from over-predicted phrases.

3.2 Voted Perceptron and Kernelization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979608">
Although the analysis above concerns the perceptron al-
gorithm, we use a modified version, the voted perceptron
algorithm, introduced in (Freund and Schapire, 1999).
The key point of the voted version is that, while train-
ing, it stores information in order to make better predic-
tions on test data. Specifically, all the prediction vec-
tors wj
generated after every mistake are stored, together
with a weight cj
, which corresponds to the number of
decisions the vector wj
survives until the next mistake.
Let J be the number of vector that a perceptron accumu-
lates. The final hypothesis is an averaged vote over the
predictions of each vector, computed with the expression
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999157">
hw(x) =
PJ
j=1 cj
(wj
x) .
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964198">
Moreover, we work with the dual formulation of the
vectors, which allows the use of kernel functions. It is
shown in (Freund and Schapire, 1999) that a vector w can
be expressed as the sum of instances xj
that were added
</bodyText>

(sxj = +1) or subtracted (sxj = 1) in order to create it,

. Given a kernel function K(x, x0
),
the final expression of a dual voted perceptron becomes:

4 Feature-Vector Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990614390243903">
In this section we describe the representation functions
w and p, which respectively map a word or a phrase
and their local context into a feature vector in Rn
, partic-
ularly, {0, 1}n
. First, we define a set of predicates which
are computed on words and return one or more values:
Form(w), PoS(w): The form and PoS of word w.
Orthographic(w): Binary flags of word w with re-
gard to how is it capitalized (initial-caps, all-caps),
the kind of characters that form the word (contains-
digits, all-digits, alphanumeric, Roman-number),
the presence of punctuation marks (contains-
dots, contains-hyphen, acronym), single character
patterns (lonely-initial, punctuation-mark, single-
char), or the membership of the word to a predefined
class (functional-word2
), or pattern (URL).
Affixes(w): The prefixes and suffixes of the word w
(up to 4 characters).
Word Type Patterns(ws . . . we): Type pattern of
consecutive words ws . . . we. The type of a word
is either functional (f), capitalized (C), lowercased
(l), punctuation mark (.), quote () or other (x).
For instance, the word type pattern for the phrase
John Smith payed 3 euros would be CClxl.
For the function w(xi) we compute the predicates in
a window of words around xi, that is, words xi+l with
l [Lw, +Lw]. Each predicate label, together with
each relative position l and each returned value forms a
final binary indicator feature. The word type patterns are
evaluated in all sequences within the window which in-
clude the central word i.
For the function p(s, e) we represent the context of
the phrase by evaluating a [Lp, 0] window of predicates
at the s word and a separate [0, +Lp] window at the e
word. At the s window, we also codify the named enti-
ties already recognized at the left context, capturing their
category and relative position. Furthermore, we represent
the (s, e) phrase by evaluating the predicates without cap-
turing the relative position in the features. In particular,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.894091">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996813">
Functional words are determiners and prepositions which
typically appear inside NEs.
\x0cfor the words within (s, e) we evaluate the form, affixes
and type patterns of sizes 2, 3 and 4. We also evaluate the
complete concatenated form of the phrase and the word
type pattern spanning the whole phrase. Finally, we make
use of a gazetteer to capture possible NE categories of the
whole NE form and each single word within it.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.99771" genericHeader="evaluation">
5 Experiments and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983125">
A list of functional words was automatically extracted
from each language training set, selecting those lower-
cased words within NEs appearing 3 times or more. For
each language, we also constructed a gazetteer with the
NEs in the training set. When training, only a random
40% of the entries was considered.
We performed parameter tuning on the English lan-
guage. Concerning the features, we set the window sizes
(Lw and Lp) to 3 (we tested 2 and 3) , and we did not con-
sidered features occurring less than 5 times in the data.
When moving to German, we found better to work with
lemmas instead of word forms.
Concerning the learning algorithm, we evaluated ker-
nel degrees from 1 to 5. Degrees 2 and 3 performed some-
what better than others, and we chose degree 2. We then
ran the algorithm through the English training set for up
to five epochs, and through the German training set for up
to 3 epochs. 3
On both languages, the performance was
still slightly increasing while visiting more training sen-
tences. Unfortunately, we were not able to run the algo-
rithm until performance was stable. Table 1 summarizes
the obtained results on all sets. Clearly, the NERC task
on English is much easier than on German. Figures indi-
cate that the moderate performance on German is mainly
caused by the low recall, specially for ORG and MISC en-
tities. It is interesting to note that while in English the
performance is much better on the development set, in
German we achieve better results on the test set. This
seems to indicate that the difference in performance be-
tween development and test sets is due to irregularities
in the NEs that appear in each set, rather than overfitting
problems of our learning strategy.
The general performance of phrase recognition system
we present is fairly good, and we think it is competitive
with state-of-the-art named entity extraction systems.

Let K be the set of NE categories, which in the CoNLL-2003 setting is K = {LOC, PER, ORG, MISC}. A NE phrase, denoted as (s, e)k, is a phrase spanning from word xs to </context>

For the NERC problem, the structures to be recognized are the named entity phrases (NE) of a sentence. First, we apply learning at word level to identify NE candidates by means of a Begin-Inside classification. Then, we make use of functions learned at phrase level one for each NE category to discriminate among competing NEs. We propose a simple online learning algorithm for training all the involved functions together. Each function is modeled as a voted perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999). The learning strategy works online at sentence level. When visiting a sentence, the functions being learned are first used to recognize the NE phrases, and then updated according to the correctness of their solution. We analyze the dependencies among the involved perceptrons and a global solution in order to design a global update rule based on the recognition of namedentities, which reflects to each individual perceptron its committed errors from a global perspective. The learning approach presented here is closely related to and inspired by some recent works in the area of NLP and Machine </context>

Note that we deliberately do not care about false positives begin or inside words which do not finally over-produce a phrase. Regarding the scoring layer, each category prediction vector is moved toward missed phrases and moved away from over-predicted phrases. 3.2 Voted Perceptron and Kernelization Although the analysis above concerns the perceptron algorithm, we use a modified version, the voted perceptron algorithm, introduced in (Freund and Schapire, 1999). The key point of the voted version is that, while training, it stores information in order to make better predictions on test data. Specifically, all the prediction vectors wj generated after every mistake are stored, together with a weight cj , which corresponds to the number of decisions the vector wj survives until the next mistake. Let J be the number of vector that a perceptron accumulates. The final hypothesis is an averaged vote over the predictions of each vector, computed with the expression hw(x) = PJ j=1 cj (wj x) . Moreover, we work with the dual formulation of the vectors, which</context>

Practically, there is no need to explicitly enumerate each possible chunking in YBI . Instead, by using dynamic programming the optimal chunking can be found in quadratic time over the sentence length, performing a Viterby-style exploration from left to right (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001). Summarizing, the NE-Chunker recognizes the set of NE phrases of a sentence as follows: First, NE candidates are identified in linear time, applying a linear number of decisions. Then, the optimal coherent set of NE phrases is selected in quadratic time, applying a quadratic number of decisions. 3 Learning via Recognition Feedback We now present an online learning strategy for training the learning components of the NE-Chunker, namely the functions hB and hI and the functions scorek, for k K. Each function is implemented using a perceptron1 and a representation function. A perceptron is a lin</context>
