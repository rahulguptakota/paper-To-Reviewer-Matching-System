Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998726">
Despite the existence of several noun phrase coref-
erence resolution data sets as well as several for-
mal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly
difficult to compare results across different corefer-
ence resolution systems. This is due to the high cost
of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference
resolution system, which often forces researchers
to substitute available gold-standard information in
lieu of implementing a module that would compute
that information. Unfortunately, this leads to incon-
sistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios.
With the aim to facilitate consistent and realis-
tic experimental evaluations in coreference resolu-
tion, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the
development of learning-based noun phrase (NP)
coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is de-
signed to facilitate the rapid creation of corefer-
ence resolution systems, easy implementation of
new feature sets and approaches to coreference res-
olution, and empirical evaluation of coreference re-
solvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and
standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile
and present experimental results showing that Rec-
oncile can be used to create a coreference resolver
that achieves performance comparable to state-of-
the-art systems on six benchmark data sets.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99923685483871">
Noun phrase coreference resolution (or simply
coreference resolution) is the problem of identi-
fying all noun phrases (NPs) that refer to the same
entity in a text. The problem of coreference res-
olution is fundamental in the field of natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) because of its usefulness
for other NLP tasks, as well as the theoretical in-
terest in understanding the computational mech-
anisms involved in government, binding and lin-
guistic reference.
Several formal evaluations have been conducted
for the coreference resolution task (e.g., MUC-6
(1995), ACE NIST (2004)), and the data sets cre-
ated for these evaluations have become standard
benchmarks in the field (e.g., MUC and ACE data
sets). However, it is still frustratingly difficult to
compare results across different coreference res-
olution systems. Reported coreference resolu-
tion scores vary wildly across data sets, evaluation
metrics, and system configurations.
We believe that one root cause of these dispar-
ities is the high cost of implementing an end-to-
end coreference resolution system. Coreference
resolution is a complex problem, and successful
systems must tackle a variety of non-trivial sub-
problems that are central to the coreference task
e.g., mention/markable detection, anaphor identi-
fication and that require substantial implemen-
tation efforts. As a result, many researchers ex-
ploit gold-standard annotations, when available, as
a substitute for component technologies to solve
these subproblems. For example, many published
research results use gold standard annotations to
identify NPs (substituting for mention/markable
detection), to distinguish anaphoric NPs from non-
anaphoric NPs (substituting for anaphoricity de-
termination), to identify named entities (substitut-
ing for named entity recognition), and to identify
the semantic types of NPs (substituting for seman-
tic class identification). Unfortunately, the use of
gold standard annotations for key/critical compo-
nent technologies leads to an unrealistic evalua-
tion setting, and makes it impossible to directly
compare results against coreference resolvers that
solve all of these subproblems from scratch.
Comparison of coreference resolvers is further
hindered by the use of several competing (and
non-trivial) evaluation measures, and data sets that
have substantially different task definitions and
annotation formats. Additionally, coreference res-
olution is a pervasive problem in NLP and many
NLP applications could benefit from an effective
coreference resolver that can be easily configured
and customized.
To address these issues, we have created a plat-
form for coreference resolution, called Reconcile,
that can serve as a software infrastructure to sup-
port the creation of, experimentation with, and
evaluation of coreference resolvers. Reconcile
was designed with the following seven desiderata
in mind:
implement the basic underlying software ar-

\x0cchitecture of contemporary state-of-the-art
learning-based coreference resolution sys-
tems;
support experimentation on most of the stan-
dard coreference resolution data sets;
implement most popular coreference resolu-
tion scoring metrics;
exhibit state-of-the-art coreference resolution
performance (i.e., it can be configured to cre-
ate a resolver that achieves performance close
to the best reported results);
can be easily extended with new methods and
features;
is relatively fast and easy to configure and
run;
has a set of pre-built resolvers that can be
used as black-box coreference resolution sys-
tems.
While several other coreference resolution sys-
tems are publicly available (e.g., Poesio and
Kabadjov (2004), Qiu et al. (2004) and Versley et
al. (2008)), none meets all seven of these desider-
ata (see Related Work). Reconcile is a modular
software platform that abstracts the basic archi-
tecture of most contemporary supervised learning-
based coreference resolution systems (e.g., Soon
et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002), Bengtson and
Roth (2008)) and achieves performance compara-
ble to the state-of-the-art on several benchmark
data sets. Additionally, Reconcile can be eas-
ily reconfigured to use different algorithms, fea-
tures, preprocessing elements, evaluation settings
and metrics.
In the rest of this paper, we review related work
(Section 2), describe Reconciles organization and
components (Section 3) and show experimental re-
sults for Reconcile on six data sets and two evalu-
ation metrics (Section 4).

Several coreference resolution systems are cur-
rently publicly available. JavaRap (Qiu et al.,
2004) is an implementation of the Lappin and
Leass (1994) Resolution of Anaphora Procedure
(RAP). JavaRap resolves only pronouns and, thus,
it is not directly comparable to Reconcile. GuiTaR
(Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004) and BART (Versley
et al., 2008) (which can be considered a succes-
sor of GuiTaR) are both modular systems that tar-
get the full coreference resolution task. As such,
both systems come close to meeting the majority
of the desiderata set forth in Section 1. BART,
in particular, can be considered an alternative to
Reconcile, although we believe that Reconciles
approach is more flexible than BARTs. In addi-
tion, the architecture and system components of
Reconcile (including a comprehensive set of fea-
tures that draw on the expertise of state-of-the-art
supervised learning approaches, such as Bengtson
and Roth (2008)) result in performance closer to
the state-of-the-art.
Coreference resolution has received much re-
search attention, resulting in an array of ap-
proaches, algorithms and features. Reconcile
is modeled after typical supervised learning ap-
proaches to coreference resolution (e.g. the archi-
tecture introduced by Soon et al. (2001)) because
of the popularity and relatively good performance
of these systems.
However, there have been other approaches
to coreference resolution, including unsupervised
and semi-supervised approaches (e.g. Haghighi
and Klein (2007)), structured approaches (e.g.
McCallum and Wellner (2004) and Finley and
Joachims (2005)), competition approaches (e.g.
Yang et al. (2003)) and a bell-tree search approach
(Luo et al. (2004)). Most of these approaches rely
on some notion of pairwise feature-based similar-
ity and can be directly implemented in Reconcile.

3 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98871">
Reconcile was designed to be a research testbed
capable of implementing most current approaches
to coreference resolution. Reconcile is written in
Java, to be portable across platforms, and was de-
signed to be easily reconfigurable with respect to
subcomponents, feature sets, parameter settings,
etc.
Reconciles architecture is illustrated in Figure
1. For simplicity, Figure 1 shows Reconciles op-
eration during the classification phase (i.e., assum-
ing that a trained classifier is present).
The basic architecture of the system includes
five major steps. Starting with a corpus of docu-
ments together with a manually annotated corefer-
ence resolution answer key1, Reconcile performs

through a series of (external) linguistic pro-
cessors such as tokenizers, part-of-speech
taggers, syntactic parsers, etc. These com-
ponents produce annotations of the text. Ta-
ble 1 lists the preprocessors currently inter-
faced in Reconcile. Note that Reconcile in-
cludes several in-house NP detectors, that
conform to the different data sets defini-
tions of what constitutes a NP (e.g., MUC
vs. ACE). All of the extractors utilize a syn-
tactic parse of the text and the output of a
Named Entity (NE) extractor, but extract dif-
ferent constructs as specialized in the corre-
sponding definition. The NP extractors suc-
cessfully recognize about 95% of the NPs in
the MUC and ACE gold standards.
2. Feature generation. Using annotations pro-
duced during preprocessing, Reconcile pro-
duces feature vectors for pairs of NPs. For
example, a feature might denote whether the
two NPs agree in number, or whether they
have any words in common. Reconcile in-
cludes over 80 features, inspired by other suc-
cessful coreference resolution systems such
as Soon et al. (2001) and Ng and Cardie
(2002).

The first two rows of Table 3 show the perfor-

Due to the difficulties outlined in Section 1,
results for Reconcile presented here are directly
comparable only to a limited number of scores

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995201454545455">
Reconcile is a general architecture for coreference
resolution that can be used to easily create various
coreference resolvers. Reconcile provides broad
support for experimentation in coreference reso-
lution, including implementation of the basic ar-
chitecture of contemporary state-of-the-art coref-
erence systems and a variety of individual mod-
ules employed in these systems. Additionally,
Reconcile handles all of the formatting and scor-
ing peculiarities of the most widely used coref-
erence resolution data sets (those created as part
of the MUC and ACE conferences) and, thus,
allows for easy implementation and evaluation
across these data sets. We hope that Reconcile
will support experimental research in coreference
resolution and provide a state-of-the-art corefer-
ence resolver for both researchers and application
developers. We believe that in this way Recon-
cile will facilitate meaningful and consistent com-
parisons of coreference resolution systems. The

<abstract confidence="0.999422555555556">Despite the existence of several noun phrase coreference resolution data sets as well as several formal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly difficult to compare results across different coreference resolution systems. This is due to the high cost of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference resolution system, which often forces researchers to substitute available gold-standard information in lieu of implementing a module that would compute that information. Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in coreference resolution, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolution systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference resolution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile and present experimental results showing that Reconcile can be used to create a coreference resolver that achieves performance comparable to state-ofthe-art systems on six benchmark data sets.</abstract>

While several other coreference resolution systems are publicly available (e.g., Poesio and Kabadjov (2004), Qiu et al. (2004) and Versley et al. (2008)), none meets all seven of these desiderata (see Related Work). Reconcile is a modular software platform that abstracts the basic architecture of most contemporary supervised learningbased coreference resolution systems (e.g., Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002), Bengtson and Roth (2008)) and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on several benchmark data sets. Additionally, Reconcile can be easily reconfigured to use different algorithms, features, preprocessing elements, evaluation settings and metrics. In the rest of this paper, we review related work (Section 2), describe Reconciles organization and components (Section 3) and show experimental results for Reconcile on six data sets and two evaluation metrics (Section 4). 2 Related Work Several coreference resolution systems are currently publicly available.

As such, both systems come close to meeting the majority of the desiderata set forth in Section 1. BART, in particular, can be considered an alternative to Reconcile, although we believe that Reconciles approach is more flexible than BARTs. In addition, the architecture and system components of Reconcile (including a comprehensive set of features that draw on the expertise of state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches, such as Bengtson and Roth (2008)) result in performance closer to the state-of-the-art. Coreference resolution has received much research attention, resulting in an array of approaches, algorithms and features. Reconcile is modeled after typical supervised learning approaches to coreference resolution (e.g. the architecture introduced by Soon et al.

Reconcile2010 is configured using the following components: 1. Preprocessing (a) Sentence Splitter: OpenNLP (b) Tokenizer: OpenNLP (c) POS Tagger: OpenNLP (d) Parser: Berkeley (e) Named Entity Recognizer: Stanford 2. Feature Set - A hand-selected subset of 60 out of the more than 80 features available. The features were selected to include most of the features from Soon et al. Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002) and Bengtson and Roth (2008). 3. Classifier - Averaged Perceptron 4. Clustering - Single-link - Positive decision threshold was tuned by cross validation of the training set. 4.3 Experimental Results The first two rows of Table 3 show the performance of Reconcile2010. For all data sets, B3 scores are higher than MUC scores. The MUC score is highest for the MUC6 data set, while B3 scores are higher for the ACE data sets as compared to the MUC data sets. Due to the difficulties outlined in Section 1, results for Reconcile presented here are directly comparable only to a limited number of scores reported in the literature. </context>

Most of these approaches rely on some notion of pairwise feature-based similarity and can be directly implemented in Reconcile. 3 System Description Reconcile was designed to be a research testbed capable of implementing most current approaches to coreference resolution. Reconcile is written in Java, to be portable across platforms, and was designed to be easily reconfigurable with respect to subcomponents, feature sets, parameter settings, etc. Reconciles arc</context>

The problem of coreference resolution is fundamental in the field of natural language processing (NLP) because of its usefulness for other NLP tasks, as well as the theoretical interest in understanding the computational mechanisms involved in government, binding and linguistic reference. Several formal evaluations have been conducted for the coreference resolution task (e.g., MUC-6 (1995), ACE NIST (2004)), and the data sets created for these evaluations have become standard benchmarks in the field (e.g., MUC and ACE data sets). However, it is still frustratingly difficult to compare results across different coreference resolution systems. Reported coreference resolution scores vary wildly across data sets, evaluation metrics, and system configurations. We believe that one root cause of these disparities is the high cost of implementing an end-toend coreference resolution system. Coreference resolution is a complex problem, and successful systems must tackle a variety of non-trivial subproblem</context>

Only about 15% of the code is concerned with running existing components in the preprocessing step, while the rest deals with NP extraction, implementations of features, clustering algorithms and scorers. More details about Reconciles architecture and available components and features can be found in Stoyanov et al. (2010). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Data Sets Reconcile incorporates the six most commonly used coreference resolution data sets, two from the MUC conferences (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1997) and four from the ACE Program (NIST, 2004). For ACE, we incorporate only the newswire portion. When available, Reconcile employs the standard test/train split. Otherwise, we randomly split the data into a training and test set following a 70/30 ratio. Performance is evaluated according to the B3 and MUC scoring metrics. 4.2 The Reconcile2010 Configuration Reconcile can be easily configured with different algorithms for markable detection, anaphoricity determination, feature extraction, etc., and run against several scoring metrics.

While several other coreference resolution systems are publicly available (e.g., Poesio and Kabadjov (2004), Qiu et al. (2004) and Versley et al. (2008)), none meets all seven of these desiderata (see Related Work). Reconcile is a modular software platform that abstracts the basic architecture of most contemporary supervised learningbased coreference resolution systems (e.g., Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002), Bengtson and Roth (2008)) and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on several benchmark data sets. Additionally, Reconcile can be easily reconfigured to use different algorithms, features, preprocessing elements, evaluation settings and metrics.

Reconcile is modeled after typical supervised learning approaches to coreference resolution (e.g. the architecture introduced by Soon et al. (2001)) because of the popularity and relatively good performance of these systems. However, there have been other approaches to coreference resolution, including unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches (e.g. Haghighi and Klein (2007)), structured approaches (e.g. McCallum and Wellner (2004) and Finley and Joachims (2005)), competition approaches (e.g. Yang et al. (2003)) and a bell-tree search approach (Luo et al. (2004)). Most of these approaches rely on some notion of pairwise feature-based similarity and can be directly implemented in Reconcile. 3 System Description Reconcile was designed to be a research testbed capable of implementing most current approaches to coreference resolution. Reconcile is written in Java, to be portable across platforms, and was designed to be easily reconfigurable with respect to subcomponents, feature sets, parameter settings, etc. Reconciles architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. For simplicity, Figure 1 shows Reconciles o</context>
