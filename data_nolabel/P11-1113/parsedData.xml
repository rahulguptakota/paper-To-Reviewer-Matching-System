Event extraction is the task of detecting certain
specified types of events that are mentioned in
the source language data. The state-of-the-art
research on the task is transductive inference
(e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we
propose a new method of event extraction by
well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to
previous inference methods, we regard entity-
type consistency as key feature to predict event
mentions. We adopt this inference method to
improve the traditional sentence-level event ex-
traction system. Experiments show that we can
get 8.6% gain in trigger (event) identification,
and more than 11.8% gain for argument (role)
classification in ACE event extraction.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.990426387096774">
The event extraction task in ACE (Automatic Con-
tent Extraction) evaluation involves three challeng-
ing issues: distinguishing events of different types,
finding the participants of an event and determin-
ing the roles of the participants.
The recent researches on the task show the
availability of transductive inference, such as that
of the following methods: cross-document, cross-
sentence and cross-event inferences. Transductive
inference is a process to use the known instances to
predict the attributes of unknown instances. As an
example, given a target event, the cross-event in-
ference can predict its type by well using the re-
lated events co-occurred with it within the same
document. From the sentence:
(1)He left the company.
it is hard to tell whether it is a Transport event in
ACE, which means that he left the place; or an
End-Position event, which means that he retired
from the company. But cross-event inference can
use a related event Then he went shopping within
the same document to identify it as a Transport
event correctly.
As the above example might suggest, the avail-
ability of transductive inference for event extrac-
tion relies heavily on the known evidences of an
event occurrence in specific condition. However,
the evidence supporting the inference is normally
unclear or absent. For instance, the relation among
events is the key clue for cross-event inference to
predict a target event type, as shown in the infer-
ence process of the sentence (1). But event relation
extraction itself is a hard task in Information Ex-
traction. So cross-event inference often suffers
from some false evidence (viz., misleading by un-
related events) or lack of valid evidence (viz., un-
successfully extracting related events).
In this paper, we propose a new method of
transductive inference, named cross-entity infer-
ence, for event extraction by well using the rela-
tions among entities. This method is firstly
motivated by the inherent ability of entity types in
revealing event types. From the sentences:
(2)He left the bathroom.
(3)He left Microsoft.
it is easy to identify the sentence (2) as a Transport
event in ACE, which means that he left the place,
because nobody would retire (End-Position type)
from a bathroom. And compared to the entities in
sentence (1) and (2), the entity Microsoft in (3)
would give us more confidence to tag the left
event as an End-Position type, because people are
used to giving the full name of the place where
they retired.
The cross-entity inference is also motivated by
the phenomenon that the entities of the same type
often attend similar events. That gives us a way to
predict event type based on entity-type consistency.
From the sentence:
(4)Obama beats McCain.
it is hard to identify it as an Elect event in ACE,
which means Obama wins the Presidential Election,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.957313">
1127
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998163913793104">
\x0cor an Attack event, which means Obama roughs
somebody up. But if we have the priori knowledge
that the sentence Bush beats McCain is an Elect
event, and Obama was a presidential contender
just like Bush (strict type consistency), we have
ample evidence to predict that the sentence (4) is
also an Elect event.
Indeed above cross-entity inference for event-
type identification is not the only use of entity-type
consistency. As we shall describe below, we can
make use of it at all issues of event extraction:
y For event type: the entities of the same type
are most likely to attend similar events. And the
events often use consistent or synonymous trigger.
y For event argument (participant): the enti-
ties of the same type normally co-occur with simi-
lar participants in the events of the same type.
y For argument role: the arguments of the
same type, for the most part, play the same roles in
similar events.
With the help of above characteristics of entity,
we can perform a step-by-step inference in this
order:
y Step 1: predicting event type and labeling
trigger given the entities of the same type.
y Step 2: identifying arguments in certain event
given priori entity type, event type and trigger that
obtained by step 1.
y Step 3: determining argument roles in certain
event given entity type, event type, trigger and ar-
guments that obtained by step 1 and step 2.
On the basis, we give a blind cross-entity infer-
ence method for event extraction in this paper. In
the method, we first regard entities as queries to
retrieve their related documents from large-scale
language resources, and use the global evidences
of the documents to generate entity-type descrip-
tions. Second we determine the type consistency of
entities by measuring the similarity of the type de-
scriptions. Finally, given the priori attributes of
events in the training data, with the help of the en-
tities of the same type, we perform the step-by-step
cross-entity inference on the attributes of test
events (candidate sentences).
In contrast to other transductive inference meth-
ods on event extraction, the cross-entity inference
makes every effort to strengthen effects of entities
in predicting event occurrences. Thus the inferen-
tial process can benefit from following aspects: 1)
less false evidence, viz. less false entity-type con-
sistency (the key clue of cross-entity inference),
because the consistency can be more precisely de-
termined with the help of fully entity-type descrip-
tion that obtained based on the related information
from Web; 2) more valid evidence, viz. more enti-
ties of the same type (the key references for the
inference), because any entity never lack its con-
geners.

2 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998790414634147">
The event extraction task we addressing is that of
the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evalua-
tions, where an event is defined as a specific occur-
rence involving participants. And event extraction
task requires that certain specified types of events
that are mentioned in the source language data be
detected. We first introduce some ACE terminol-
ogy to understand this task more easily:
y Entity: an object or a set of objects in one of
the semantic categories of interest, referred to in
the document by one or more (co-referential) entity
mentions.
y Entity mention: a reference to an entity (typi-
cally, a noun phrase).
y Event trigger: the main word that most clear-
ly expresses an event occurrence (An ACE event
trigger is generally a verb or a noun).
y Event arguments: the entity mentions that
are involved in an event (viz., participants).
y Argument roles: the relation of arguments to
the event where they participate.
y Event mention: a phrase or sentence within
which an event is described, including trigger and
arguments.
The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events,
with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we
will treat these simply as 33 separate event types
and do not consider the hierarchical structure
among them. Besides, the ACE evaluation plan
defines the following standards to determine the
correctness of an event extraction:
y A trigger is correctly labeled if its event type
and offset (viz., the position of the trigger word in
text) match a reference trigger.
y An argument is correctly identified if its event
type and offsets match any of the reference argu-
ment mentions, in other word, correctly recogniz-
ing participants in an event.
y An argument is correctly classified if its role
matches any of the reference argument mentions.
Consider the sentence:

the license of a single doctor for committing medi-
cal errors.1
The event extractor should detect an End-
Position event mention, along with the trigger
word revoke, the position doctor, the person
whose license should be revoked, and the time dur-
ing which the event happened:

It is noteworthy that event extraction depends on
previous phases like name identification, entity
mention co-reference and classification. Thereinto,
the name identification is another hard task in ACE
evaluation and not the focus in this paper. So we
skip the phase and instead directly use the entity
labels provided by ACE.

Almost all the current ACE event extraction sys-
tems focus on processing one sentence at a time
(Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006; Hardyet al.
2006). However, there have been several studies
using high-level information from a wider scope:
Maslennikov and Chua (2007) use discourse
trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-
based framework to incorporate wider context to
refine the performance of relation extraction. They
claimed that discourse information could filter noi-
sy dependency paths as well as increasing the reli-
ability of dependency path extraction.
Finkel et al. (2005) used Gibbs sampling, a sim-
ple Monte Carlo method used to perform approxi-
mate inference in factored probabilistic models. By
using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi de-
coding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs,
and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local
structure while preserving tractable inference.
They used this technique to augment an informa-
tion extraction system with long-distance depend-
ency models, enforcing label consistency and
extraction template consistency constraints.
Ji and Grishman (2008) were inspired from the
hypothesis of One Sense Per Discourse (Ya-

rowsky, 1995); they extended the scope from a
single document to a cluster of topic-related docu-
ments and employed a rule-based approach to
propagate consistent trigger classification and
event arguments across sentences and documents.
Combining global evidence from related docu-
ments with local decisions, they obtained an appre-
ciable improvement in both event and event
argument identification.
Patwardhan and Riloff (2009) proposed an event
extraction model which consists of two compo-
nents: a model for sentential event recognition,
which offers a probabilistic assessment of whether
a sentence is discussing a domain-relevant event;
and a model for recognizing plausible role fillers,
which identifies phrases as role fillers based upon
the assumption that the surrounding context is dis-
cussing a relevant event. This unified probabilistic
model allows the two components to jointly make
decisions based upon both the local evidence sur-
rounding each phrase and the peripheral vision.
Gupta and Ji (2009) used cross-event informa-
tion within ACE extraction, but only for recovering
implicit time information for events.
Liao and Grishman (2010) propose document
level cross-event inference to improve event ex-
traction. In contrast to Guptas work, Liao do not
limit themselves to time information for events, but
rather use related events and event-type consis-
tency to make predictions or resolve ambiguities
regarding a given event.

4 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815352941176">
In event extraction, current transductive inference
methods focus on the issue that many events are
missing or spuriously tagged because the local in-
formation is not sufficient to make a confident de-
cision. The solution is to mine credible evidences
of event occurrences from global information and
regard that as priori knowledge to predict unknown
event attributes, such as that of cross-document
and cross-event inference methods.
However, by analyzing the sentence-level base-
line event extraction, we found that the entities
within a sentence, as the most important local in-
formation, actually contain sufficient clues for
event detection. It is only based on the premise that
we know the backgrounds of the entities before-
hand. For instance, if we knew the entity vesu-
vius is an active volcano, we could easily identify
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.959648">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.976423">
\x0cthe word erupt, which co-occurred with the en-
tity, as the trigger of a volcanic eruption event
but not that of a spotty rash.
In spite of that, it is actually difficult to use an
entity to directly infer an event occurrence because
we normally dont know the inevitable connection
between the background of the entity and the event
attributes. But we can well use the entities of the
same background to perform the inference. In de-
tail, if we first know entity(a) has the same back-
ground with entity(b), and we also know that
entity(a), as a certain role, participates in a specific
event, then we can predict that entity(b) might par-
ticiptes in a similar event as the same role.
Consider the two sentences2
from ACE corpus:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.702295666666667">
(5) American case for war against Saddam.
(6) Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief op-
erations officer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.880561">
The sentences are two event mentions which
have the same attributes:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.994540333333333">

</figure>
<tableCaption confidence="0.882942">
Table 2: Cross-entity inference example

<bodyText confidence="0.9977689375">
From the sentences, we can find that the entities
Saddam and Qaeda chief have the same back-
ground (viz., terrorist leader), and they are both the
arguments of Attack events as the role of Target.
So if we previously know any of the event men-
tions, we can infer another one with the help of the
entities of the same background.
In a word, the cross-entity inference, we pro-
posed for event extraction, bases on the hypothesis:
Entities of the consistent type normally partici-
pate in similar events as the same role.
As we will introduce below, some statistical da-
ta from ACE training corpus can support the hy-
pothesis, which show the consistency of event type
and role in event mentions where entities of the
same type occur.

ing in more than 10 event types. And when the fre-
quency is larger than 50, there are 41 (95%) entity

These distributions show the fact that most in-
stances of a certain entity type normally participate
in events of the same type. And the distributions
might be good predictors for event type detection
and trigger determination.

Besides, an ACE entity type actually can be di-

similarity of background of entity, and such a sub-
type nearly always co-occur with unique event
type. For example, the Air entities can be roughly
divided into 4 subtypes: Fighter plane, Spacecraft,
Civil aviation and Private plane, within which the
Fighter plane entities all appear in Attack event
mentions, and other three subtypes all co-occur
with Transport events (see Table 5). This consis-

5 Cross-entity Approach

<bodyText confidence="0.99768405882353">
In this section we present our approach to using
blind cross-entity inference to improve sentence-
level ACE event extraction.
Our event extraction system extracts events in-
dependently for each sentence, because the defini-
tion of event mention constrains them to appear in
the same sentence. Every sentence that at least in-
volves one entity mention will be regarded as a
candidate event mention, and a randomly selected
entity mention from the candidate will be the star-
ing of the whole extraction process. For the entity
mention, information retrieval is used to mine its
background knowledge from Web, and its type is
determined by comparing the knowledge with
those in training corpus. Based on the entity type,
the extraction system performs our step-by-step
cross-entity inference to predict the attributes of

In the training process, for every entity type in
the ACE training corpus, a clustering technique
(CLUTO toolkit)3
is used to divide it into different
cohesive subtypes, each of which only contains the
entities of the same background. For instance, the
Air entities will be divided into Fighter plane,
Spacecraft, Civil aviation, Private plane, etc (see
Table 5). And for each subtype, we mine event
mentions where this type of entities appear from
ACE training corpus, and extract all the words
which trigger the events to establish corresponding
trigger list. Besides, a set of support vector ma-
chine (SVM) based classifiers are also trained:

It is noteworthy that a sentence may include more than one
event (more than one trigger). So it is necessary to distinguish
arguments of a potential trigger from that of others.
In the test process, for each candidate event
mention, our event extraction system firstly pre-
dicts its triggers and event types: given an ran-
domly selected entity mention from the candidate,
the system determines the entity subtype it belong-
ing to and the corresponding trigger list, and then
all non-entity words in the candidate are scanned
for a instance of triggers from the list. When an
instance is found, the system tags the candidate as
the event type that the most frequently co-occurs
with the entity subtype in the events that triggered
by the instance. Secondly the argument classifier is
applied to the remaining mentions in the candidate;
for any argument passing that classifier, the role
classifier is used to assign a role to it. Finally, once
all arguments have been assigned, the reportable-
event classifier is applied to the candidate; if the
result is successful, this event mention is reported.

One of the most important pretreatments before
our blind cross-entity inference is to divide the
ACE entity type into more cohesive subtype. The
greater consistency among backgrounds of entities
in such a subtype might be good to improve the
precision of cross-entity inference.

\x0cFor each ACE entity type, we collect all entity
mentions of the type from training corpus, and re-
gard each such mention as a query to retrieve the
50 most relevant documents from Web. Then we
select 50 key words that the most weighted by
TFIDF in the documents to roughly describe back-
ground of entity. After establishing the vector
space model (VSM) for each entity mention of the
type, we adopt a clustering toolkit (CLUTO) to
further divide the mentions into different subtypes.
Finally, for each subtype, we describe its centroid
by using 100 key words which the most frequently
occurred in relevant documents of entities of the
subtype.
In the test process, for an entity mention in a
candidate event mention, we determine its type by
comparing its background against all centroids of
subtypes in training corpus, and the subtype whose
centroid has the most Cosine similarity with the
background will be assigned to the entity. It is
noteworthy that global information from the Web
is only used to measure the entity-background con-
sistency and not directly in the inference process.
Thus our event extraction system actually still per-
forms a sentence-level inference based on local
information.

5.2 Cross-Entity Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838777777778">
Our event extraction system adopts a step-by-
step cross-entity inference to predict event. As dis-
cussed above, the first step is to determine the trig-
ger in a candidate event mention and tag its event
type based on consistency of entity type. Given the
domain of event mention that restrained by the
known trigger, event type and entity subtype, the
second step is to distinguish the most probable ar-
guments that co-occurring in the domain from the
non-arguments. Then for each of the arguments,
the third step can use the co-occurring arguments
in the domain as important contexts to predict its
role. Finally, the inference process determines
whether the candidate is a reportable event men-
tion according to a confidence coefficient. In the
following sections, we focus on introducing the
three classifiers: argument classifier, role classifier
and reportable-event classifier.

<bodyText confidence="0.999029733333333">
For a candidate event mention, the first step
gives its event type, which roughly restrains the
domain of event mentions where the arguments of
the candidate might co-occur. On the basis, given
an entity mention in the candidate and its type (see
the pretreatment process in section 5.1), the argu-
ment classifier could predict whether other entity
mentions co-occur with it in such a domain, if yes,
all the mentions will be the arguments of the can-
didate. In other words, if we know an entity of a
certain type participates in some event, we will
think of what entities also should participate in the
event. For instance, when we know a defendant
goes on trial, we can conclude that the judge, law-
yer and witness should appear in court.

type co-occurs with other subtypes in such an

the role of Arg1 is Victim. On the basis, with the

\x0cprecise. For instance, if the Arg1 and Arg2 co-
occur in an Attack event mention, we will have
more confidence in the Victim role of Arg1.
Besides, as discussed in section 4, entities of the
same type normally take on the same role in simi-
lar events, especially when they co-occur with sim-
ilar arguments in the events (see Table 2).
Therefore, all instances of co-occurrence model
{entity subtype, event type, arguments} in training
corpus could provide effective evidences for pre-
dicting the role of argument in the candidate event
mention. Based on this, we trained a SVM-based
role classifier which uses following features:
y Feature 1 and Feature 2 (see Table 7)

At this point, there are still two issues need to be
resolved. First, some triggers are common words
which often mislead the extraction of candidate
event mention, such as it, this, what, etc.
These words only appear in a few event mentions
as trigger, but when they once appear in trigger list,
a large quantity of noisy sentences will be regarded
as candidates because of their commonness in sen-
tences. Second, some arguments might be tagged
as more than one role in specific event mentions,
but as ACE event guideline, one argument only
takes on one role in a sentence. So we need to re-
move those with low confidence.
A confidence coefficient is used to distinguish
the correct triggers and roles from wrong ones. The
coefficient calculate the frequency of a trigger (or a
role) appearing in specific domain of event men-
tions and that in whole training corpus, then com-
bines them to represent its confidence degree, just
like TFIDF algorithm. Thus, the more typical trig-
gers (or roles) will be given high confidence.
Based on the coefficient, we use a SVM-based
classifier to determine the reportable events. Each
feature of this classifier is the conjunction of:
y An event type (domain of event mentions)
y Confidence coefficients of triggers in domain
y Confidence coefficients of roles in the domain.

We followed Liao (2010)s evaluation and ran-
domly select 10 newswire texts from the ACE
2005 training corpus as our development set,
which is used for parameter tuning, and then con-
duct a blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005
newswire texts. We use the rest of the ACE train-
ing corpus (549 documents) as training data for our
event extraction system.
To compare with the reported work on cross-
event inference (Liao, 2010) and its sentence-level
baseline system, we cross-validate our method on
10 separate sets of 40 ACE texts, and report the
optimum, worst and mean performances (see Table
8) on the data by using Precision (P), Recall (R)
and F-measure (F). In addition, we also report the
performance of two human annotators on 40 ACE
newswire texts (a random blind test set): one
knows the rules of event extraction; the other
knows nothing about it.

6.1 Main Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99723515625">
From the results presented in Table 8, we can
see that using the cross-entity inference, we can
improve the F score of sentence-level event extrac-
tion for trigger classification by 8.59%, argument
classification by 11.86%, and role classification by
11.9% (mean performance). Compared to the
cross-event inference, we gains 2.87% improve-
ment for argument classification, and 3.81% for
role classification (mean performance). Especially,
our worst results also have better performances
than cross-event inference.
Nonetheless, the cross-entity inference has
worse F score for trigger determination. As we can
see, the low Recall score weaken its F score (see
Table 8). Actually, we select the sentence which at
least includes one entity mention as candidate
event mention, but lots of event mentions in ACE
never include any entity mention. Thus we have
missed some mentions at the starting of inference
process.
In addition, the annotator who knows the rules
of event extraction has a similar performance trend
with systems: high for trigger classification, mid-
dle for argument classification, and low for role
classification (see Table 8). But the annotator who
never works in this field obtains a different trend:
higher performance for argument classification.
This phenomenon might prove that the step-by-
step inference is not the only way to predicate
event mention because human can determine ar-
guments without considering triggers and event
types.

6.2 Influence of Clustering on Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995697604166667">
A main part of our blind inference system is the
entity-type consistency detection, which relies
heavily on the correctness of entity clustering and
similarity measurement. In training, we used
CLUTO clustering toolkit to automatically gener-
ate different types of entities based on their back-
ground-similarities. In testing, we use K-nearest
neighbor algorithm to determine entity type.

b-1 bomber a-10 warthog f-14 aircraft apache heli-
copter terrorist Saddam Saddam Hussein Bagh-
dad...
Table 9: Noises in subtype 1 of Air entities (The
blod fonts are noises)
We obtained 129 entity subtypes from training
set. By randomly inspecting 10 subtypes, we found
nearly every subtype involves no less than 19.2%
noises. For example, the subtype 1 of Air in Ta-
ble 5 lost the entities of MiGs and enemy
planes, but involved terrorist, Saddam, etc
(See Table 9). Therefore, we manually clustered
the subtypes and retry the step-by-step cross-entity
inference. The results (denoted as Visible 1) are
shown in Table 10, within which, we additionally
show the performance of the inference on the
rough entity types provided by ACE (denoted as
Visible 2), such as the type of Air, Popula-
tion-Center, Exploding, etc., which normally
can be divided into different more cohesive sub-
types. And the Blind in Table 10 denotes the
performances on our subtypes obtained by CLUTO.
It is surprised that the performances (see Table
10, F-score) on Visible 1 entity subtypes are just
a little better than Blind inference. So it seems
that the noises in our blind entity types (CLUTO
clusters) dont hurt the inference much. But by re-
inspecting the Visible 1 subtypes, we found that
their granularities are not enough small: the 89
manual entity clusters actually can be divided into
more cohesive subtypes. So the improvements of
inference on noise-free Visible 1 subtypes are
partly offset by loss on weakly consistent entities
in the subtypes. It can be proved by the poor per-
formances on Visible 2 subtypes which are much
more general than Visible 1. Therefore, a rea-
sonable clustering method is important in our in-
ference process.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882111111111">
We propose a blind cross-entity inference method
for event extraction, which well uses the consis-
tency of entity mention to achieve sentence-level
trigger and argument (role) classification. Experi-
ments show that the method has better perform-
ance than cross-document and cross-event
inferences in ACE event extraction.
The inference presented here only considers the
helpfulness of entity types of arguments to role
classification. But as a superior feature, contextual
roles can provide more effective assistance to role
determination of local argument. For instance,
when an Attack argument appears in a sentence, a
Target might be there. So if we firstly identify
simple roles, such as the condition that an argu-
ment has only a single role, and then use the roles
as priori knowledge to classify hard ones, may be
able to further improve performance.

<abstract confidence="0.9912240625">Event extraction is the task of detecting certain specified types of events that are mentioned in the source language data. The state-of-the-art research on the task is transductive inference (e.g. cross-event inference). In this paper, we propose a new method of event extraction by well using cross-entity inference. In contrast to previous inference methods, we regard entitytype consistency as key feature to predict event mentions. We adopt this inference method to improve the traditional sentence-level event extraction system.

(2005) used Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. They used this technique to augment an information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. Ji and Grishman (2008) were inspired from the hypothesis of One Sense Per Discourse (Ya1 Selected from the file CNN_CF_20030304.1900.02 in ACE-2005 corpus. rowsky, 1995); they extended the scope from a single document to a cluster of topic-related documents and employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent trigger classification and event arguments across sentences and documents. Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, they obtained an appreciable improvement in both event and event argument identification.

This unified probabilistic model allows the two components to jointly make decisions based upon both the local evidence surrounding each phrase and the peripheral vision. Gupta and Ji (2009) used cross-event information within ACE extraction, but only for recovering implicit time information for events. Liao and Grishman (2010) propose document level cross-event inference to improve event extraction. In contrast to Guptas work, Liao do not limit themselves to time information for events, but rather use related events and event-type consistency to make predictions or resolve ambiguities regarding a given event. 4 Motivation In event extraction, current transductive inference methods focus on the issue that many events are missing or spuriously tagged because the local information is not sufficient to make a confident decision. The solution is to mine credible evidences of event occurrences from global information and</context>
