<bodyText confidence="0.9989036">
Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion is the
process of producing a correct phoneme
sequence for a word, given its letters. It
is often desirable to reduce the quantity of
training data and hence human anno-
tation that is needed to train an L2P
classifier for a new language. In this pa-
per, we confront the challenge of building
an accurate L2P classifier with a minimal
amount of training data by combining sev-
eral diverse techniques: context ordering,
letter clustering, active learning, and pho-
netic L2P alignment. Experiments on six
languages show up to 75% reduction in an-
notation effort.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999473984126984">
The task of letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion
is to produce a correct sequence of phonemes,
given the letters that comprise a word. An ac-
curate L2P converter is an important component
of a text-to-speech system. In general, a lookup
table does not suffice for L2P conversion, since
out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., proper names) are
inevitably encountered. This motivates the need
for classification techniques that can predict the
phonemes for an unseen word.
Numerous studies have contributed to the de-
velopment of increasingly accurate L2P sys-
tems (Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser,
2001; Bisani and Ney, 2002; Demberg et al., 2007;
Jiampojamarn et al., 2008). A common assump-
tion made in these works is that ample amounts of
labelled data are available for training a classifier.
Yet, in practice, this is the case for only a small
number of languages. In order to train an L2P clas-
sifier for a new language, we must first annotate
words in that language with their correct phoneme
sequences. As annotation is expensive, we would
like to minimize the amount of effort that is re-
quired to build an adequate training set. The ob-
jective of this work is not necessarily to achieve
state-of-the-art performance when presented with
large amounts of training data, but to outperform
other approaches when training data is limited.
This paper proposes a system for training an ac-
curate L2P classifier while requiring as few an-
notated words as possible. We employ decision
trees as our supervised learning method because of
their transparency and flexibility. We incorporate
context ordering into a decision tree learner that
guides its tree-growing procedure towards gener-
ating more intuitive rules. A clustering over letters
serves as a back-off model in cases where individ-
ual letter counts are unreliable. An active learning
technique is employed to request the phonemes
(labels) for the words that are expected to be the
most informative. Finally, we apply a novel L2P
alignment technique based on phonetic similarity,
which results in impressive gains in accuracy with-
out relying on any training data.
Our empirical evaluation on several L2P
datasets demonstrates that significant reductions
in annotation effort are indeed possible in this do-
main. Individually, all four enhancements improve
the accuracy of our decision tree learner. The com-
bined system yields savings of up to 75% in the
number of words that have to be labelled, and re-
ductions of at least 52% are observed on all the
datasets. This is achieved without any additional
tuning for the various languages.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 ex-
plains how supervised learning for L2P conversion
is carried out with decision trees, our classifier of
choice. Sections 3 through 6 describe our four
main contributions towards reducing the annota-
tion effort for L2P: context ordering (Section 3),
clustering letters (Section 4), active learning (Sec-
tion 5), and phonetic alignment (Section 6). Our
experimental setup and results are discussed in

2 Decision tree learning of L2P classifiers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997923236842105">
In this work, we employ a decision tree model
to learn the mapping from words to phoneme se-
quences. Decision tree learners are attractive be-
cause they are relatively fast to train, require little
or no parameter tuning, and the resulting classifier
can be interpreted by the user. A number of prior
studies have applied decision trees to L2P data and
have reported good generalization accuracy (An-
dersen et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998; Kienappel
and Kneser, 2001). Also, the widely-used Festi-
val Speech Synthesis System (Taylor et al., 1998)
relies on decision trees for L2P conversion.
We adopt the standard approach of using the
letter context as features. The decision tree pre-
dicts the phoneme for the focus letter based on
the m letters that appear before and after it in
the word (including the focus letter itself, and be-
ginning/end of word markers, where applicable).
The model predicts a phoneme independently for
each letter in a given word. In order to keep our
model simple and transparent, we do not explore
the possibility of conditioning on adjacent (pre-
dicted) phonemes. Any improvement in accuracy
resulting from the inclusion of phoneme features
would also be realized by the baseline that we
compare against, and thus would not materially in-
fluence our findings.
We employ binary decision trees because they
substantially outperformed n-ary trees in our pre-
liminary experiments. In L2P, there are many
unique values for each attribute, namely, the let-
ters of a given alphabet. In a n-ary tree each de-
cision node partitions the data into n subsets, one
per letter, that are potentially sparse. By contrast,
a binary tree creates one branch for the nominated
letter, and one branch grouping the remaining let-
ters into a single subset. In the forthcoming exper-
iments, we use binary decision trees exclusively.

3 Context ordering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999811796296296">
In the L2P task, context letters that are adjacent
to the focus letter tend to be more important than
context letters that are further away. For exam-
ple, the English letter c is usually pronounced as
[s] if the following letter is e or i. The general
tree-growing algorithm has no notion of the letter
distance, but instead chooses the letters on the ba-
sis of their estimated information gain (Manning
and Schutze, 1999). As a result, it will sometimes
query a letter at position +3 (denoted l3), for ex-
ample, before examining the letters that are closer
to the center of the context window.
We propose to modify the tree-growing proce-
dure to encourage the selection of letters near the
focus letter before those at greater offsets are ex-
amined. In its strictest form, which resembles
the dynamically expanding context search strat-
egy of Davel and Barnard (2004), li can only be
queried after l0, . . . , li1 have been queried. How-
ever, this approach seems overly rigid for L2P. In
English, for example, l2 can directly influence the
pronunciation of a vowel regardless of the value of
l1 (c.f., the difference between rid and ride).
Instead, we adopt a less intrusive strategy,
which we refer to as context ordering, that biases
the decision tree toward letters that are closer to
the focus, but permits gaps when the information
gain for a distant letter is relatively high. Specif-
ically, the ordering constraint described above is
still applied, but only to letters that have above-
average information gain (where the average is
calculated across all letters/attributes). This means
that a letter with above-average gain that is eligi-
ble with respect to the ordering will take prece-
dence over an ineligible letter that has an even
higher gain. However, if all the eligible letters
have below-average gain, the ineligible letter with
the highest gain is selected irrespective of its posi-
tion. Our only strict requirement is that the focus
letter must always be queried first, unless its infor-
mation gain is zero.
Kienappel and Kneser (2001) also worked on
improving decision tree performance for L2P, and
devised tie-breaking rules in the event that the tree-
growing procedure ranked two or more questions
as being equally informative. In our experience
with L2P datasets, exact ties are rare; our context
ordering mechanism will have more opportunities
to guide the tree-growing process. We expect this
change to improve accuracy, especially when the
amount of training data is very limited. By biasing
the decision tree learner toward questions that are
intuitively of greater utility, we make it less prone
to overfitting on small data samples.

\x0cYet, when making predictions for unseen words,
contexts will inevitably be encountered that did
not appear in the training data. Instead of rely-
ing solely on the particular letters that surround
the focus letter, we postulate that the learner could
achieve better generalization if it had access to
information about the types of letters that appear
before and after. That is, instead of treating let-
ters as abstract symbols, we would like to encode
knowledge of the similarity between certain letters
as features. One way of achieving this goal is to
group the letters into classes or clusters based on
their contextual similarity. Then, when a predic-
tion has to be made for an unseen (or low probabil-
ity) letter sequence, the letter classes can provide
additional information.
Kienappel and Kneser (2001) report accuracy
gains when applying letter clustering to the L2P
task. However, their decision tree learner incorpo-
rates neighboring phoneme predictions, and em-
ploys a variety of different pruning strategies; the
portion of the gains attributable to letter clustering
are not evident. In addition to exploring the effect
of letter clustering on a wider range of languages,
we are particularly concerned with the impact that
clustering has on decision tree performance when
the training set is small. The addition of letter class
features to the data may enable the active learner
to better evaluate candidate words in the pool, and
therefore make more informed selections.
To group the letters into classes, we employ
a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Brown et al.,
1992). One advantage of inducing a hierarchy is
that we need not commit to a particular level of
granularity; in other words, we are not required to
specify the number of classes beforehand, as is the
case with some other clustering algorithms.1
The clustering algorithm is initialized by plac-
ing each letter in its own class, and then pro-
ceeds in a bottom-up manner. At each step, the
pair of classes is merged that leads to the small-
est loss in the average mutual information (Man-
ning and Schutze, 1999) between adjacent classes.
The merging process repeats until a single class
remains that contains all the letters in the alpha-
bet. Recall that in our problem setting we have
access to a (presumably) large pool of unanno-
tated words. The unigram and bigram frequen-
cies required by the clustering algorithm are cal-

be grouped into classes prior to annotation. The
letter classes only need to be computed once for
a given language. We implemented a brute-force
version of the algorithm that examines all the pos-
sible merges at each step, and generates a hierar-
chy within a few hours. However, when dealing
with a larger number of unique tokens (e.g., when
clustering words instead of letters), additional op-
timizations are needed in order to make the proce-
dure tractable.
The resulting hierarchy takes the form of a bi-
nary tree, where the root node/cluster contains all
the letters, and each leaf contains a single let-
ter. Hence, each letter can be represented by a bit
string that describes the path from the root to its
leaf. As an illustration, the clustering in Table 1
was automatically generated from the words in the
English CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (Carnegie
Mellon University, 1998). It is interesting to note
that the first bit distinguishes vowels from con-
sonants, meaning that these were the last two
groups that were merged by the clustering algo-
rithm. Note also that the beginning/end of word
marker (#) is included in the hierarchy, and is the
last character to be absorbed into a larger clus-
ter. This indicates that # carries more informa-
tion than most letters, as is to be expected, in light
of its distinct status. We also experimented with
a manually-constructed letter hierarchy, but ob-
served no significant differences in accuracy vis-
a-vis the automatic clustering.

\x0c5 Active learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999051269662921">
Whereas a passive supervised learning algorithm
is provided with a collection of training exam-
ples that are typically drawn at random, an active
learner has control over the labelled data that it ob-
tains (Cohn et al., 1992). The latter attempts to se-
lect its training set intelligently by requesting the
labels of only those examples that are judged to be
the most useful or informative. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that active learners can make
more efficient use of unlabelled data than do pas-
sive learners (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998; Miller
et al., 2004; Culotta and McCallum, 2005). How-
ever, relatively few researchers have applied active
learning techniques to the L2P domain. This is
despite the fact that annotated data for training an
L2P classifier is not available in most languages.
We briefly review two relevant studies before pro-
ceeding to describe our active learning strategy.
Maskey et al. (2004) propose a bootstrapping
technique that iteratively requests the labels of the
n most frequent words in a corpus. A classifier is
trained on the words that have been annotated thus
far, and then predicts the phonemes for each of the
n words being considered. Words for which the
prediction confidence is above a certain threshold
are immediately added to the lexicon, while the re-
maining words must be verified (and corrected, if
necessary) by a human annotator. The main draw-
back of such an approach lies in the risk of adding
erroneous entries to the lexicon when the classifier
is overly confident in a prediction.
Kominek and Black (2006) devise a word se-
lection strategy based on letter n-gram coverage
and word length. Their method slightly outper-
forms random selection, thereby establishing pas-
sive learning as a strong baseline. However, only a
single Italian dataset was used, and the results do
not necessarily generalize to other languages.
In this paper, we propose to apply an ac-
tive learning technique known as Query-by-
Bagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998). We con-
sider a pool-based active learning setting, whereby
the learner has access to a pool of unlabelled ex-
amples (words), and may obtain labels (phoneme
sequences) at a cost. This is an iterative proce-
dure in which the learner trains a classifier on the
current set of labelled training data, then selects
one or more new examples to label, according to
the classifiers predictions on the pool data. Once
labelled, these examples are added to the training
set, the classifier is re-trained, and the process re-
peats until some stopping criterion is met (e.g., an-
notation resources are exhausted).
Query-by-Bagging (QBB) is an instance of the
Query-by-Committee algorithm (Freund et al.,
1997), which selects examples that have high clas-
sification variance. At each iteration, QBB em-
ploys the bagging procedure (Breiman, 1996) to
create a committee of classifiers C. Given a train-
ing set T containing k examples (in our setting,
k is the total number of letters that have been la-
belled), bagging creates each committee member
by sampling k times from T (with replacement),
and then training a classifier Ci on the resulting
data. The example in the pool that maximizes the
disagreement among the predictions of the com-
mittee members is selected.
A crucial question is how to calculate the
disagreement among the predicted phoneme se-
quences for a word in the pool. In the L2P domain,
we assume that a human annotator specifies the
phonemes for an entire word, and that the active
learner cannot query individual letters. We require
a measure of confidence at the word level; yet, our
classifiers make predictions at the letter level. This
is analogous to the task of estimating record confi-
dence using field confidence scores in information
extraction (Culotta and McCallum, 2004).
Our solution is as follows. Let w be a word in
the pool. Each classifier Ci predicts the phoneme
for each letter l w. These votes are aggre-
gated to produce a vector vl for letter l that indi-
cates the distribution of the |C |predictions over its
possible phonemes. We then compute the margin
for each letter: If {p, p0} vl are the two highest
vote totals, then the margin is M(vl) = |p p0|.
A small margin indicates disagreement among the
constituent classifiers. We define the disagreement
score for the entire word as the minimum margin:

<equation confidence="0.999337666666667">
score(w) = min
lw
{M(vl)} (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979295">
We also experimented with maximum vote en-
tropy and average margin/entropy, where the av-
erage is taken over all the letters in a word. The
minimum margin exhibited the best performance
on our development data; hence, we do not pro-
vide a detailed evaluation of the other measures.

\x0cphonemes. However, a lexicon typically provides
just the letter and phoneme sequences for each
word, without specifying the specific phoneme(s)
that each letter elicits. The sub-task of L2P that
pairs letters with phonemes in the training data is
referred to as alignment. The L2P alignments that
are specified in the training data can influence the
accuracy of the resulting L2P classifier. In our set-
ting, we are interested in mapping each letter to
either a single phoneme or the null phoneme.
The standard approach to L2P alignment is de-
scribed by Damper et al. (2005). It performs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure that
takes a (preferably large) collection of words as
input and computes alignments for them simul-
taneously. However, since in our active learning
setting the data is acquired incrementally, we can-
not count on the initial availability of a substantial
set of words accompanied by their phonemic tran-
scriptions.
In this paper, we apply the ALINE algorithm
to the task of L2P alignment (Kondrak, 2000;
Inkpen et al., 2007). ALINE, which performs
phonetically-informed alignment of two strings of
phonemes, requires no training data, and so is
ideal for our purposes. Since our task requires the
alignment of phonemes with letters, we wish to re-
place every letter with a phoneme that is the most
likely to be produced by that letter. On the other
hand, we would like our approach to be language-
independent. Our solution is to simply treat ev-
ery letter as an IPA symbol (International Phonetic
Association, 1999). The IPA is based on the Ro-
man alphabet, but also includes a number of other
symbols. The 26 IPA letter symbols tend to cor-
respond to the usual phonetic value that the letter
represents in the Latin script.2 For example, the
IPA symbol [m] denotes voiced bilabial nasal,
which is the phoneme represented by the letter m
in most languages that utilize Latin script.
The alignments produced by ALINE are of high
quality. The example below shows the alignment
of the Italian word scianchi to its phonetic tran-
scription [SaNki]. ALINE correctly aligns not only
identical IPA symbols (i:i), but also IPA symbols
that represent similar sounds (s:S, n:N, c:k).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937293604166667">
We performed experiments on six datasets, which
were obtained from the PRONALSYL letter-
to-phoneme conversion challenge.3 They are:
English CMUDict (Carnegie Mellon University,
1998); French BRULEX (Content et al., 1990),
Dutch and German CELEX (Baayen et al., 1996),
the Italian Festival dictionary (Cosi et al., 2000),
and the Spanish lexicon. Duplicate words and
words containing punctuation or numerals were
removed, as were abbreviations and acronyms.
The resulting datasets range in size from 31,491
to 111,897 words. The PRONALSYL datasets are
already divided into 10 folds; we used the first fold
as our test set, and the other folds were merged to-
gether to form the learning set. In our preliminary
experiments, we randomly set aside 10 percent of
this learning set to serve as our development set.
Since the focus of our work is on algorithmic
enhancements, we simulate the annotator with an
oracle and do not address the potential human in-
terface factors. During an experiment, 100 words
were drawn at random from the learning set; these
constituted the data on which an initial classifier
was trained. The rest of the words in the learning
set formed the unlabelled pool for active learning;
their phonemes were hidden, and a given words
phonemes were revealed if the word was selected
for labelling. After training a classifier on the
100 annotated words, we performed 190 iterations
of active learning. On each iteration, 10 words
were selected according to Equation 1, labelled by
an oracle, and added to the training set. In or-
der to speed up the experiments, a random sam-
ple of 2000 words was drawn from the pool and
presented to the active learner each time. Hence,
QBB selected 10 words from the 2000 candidates.
We set the QBB committee size |C |to 10.
At each step, we measured word accuracy with
respect to the holdout set as the percentage of test
words that yielded no erroneous phoneme predic-
tions. Henceforth, we use accuracy to refer to
word accuracy. Note that although we query ex-
amples using a committee, we train a single tree on
these examples in order to produce an intelligible
model. Prior work has demonstrated that this con-
figuration performs well in practice (Dwyer and
Holte, 2007). Our results report the accuracy of
the single tree grown on each iteration, averaged

For our decision tree learner, we utilized the J48
algorithm provided by Weka (Witten and Frank,
2005). We also experimented with Wagon (Taylor
et al., 1998), an implementation of CART, but J48
performed better during preliminary trials. We ran
J48 with default parameter settings, except that bi-
nary trees were grown (see Section 2), and subtree
raising was disabled.4
Our feature template was established during de-
velopment set experiments with the English CMU
data; the data from the other five languages did not
influence these choices. The letter context con-
sisted of the focus letter and the 3 letters appear-
ing before and after the focus (or beginning/end of
word markers, where applicable). For letter class
features, bit strings of length 1 through 6 were
used for the focus letter and its immediate neigh-
bors. Bit strings of length at most 3 were used
at positions +2 and 2, and no such features were
added at 3.5 We experimented with other config-
urations, including using bit strings of up to length
6 at all positions, but they did not produce consis-
tent improvements over the selected scheme.

We first examine the contributions of the indi-
vidual system components, and then compare our
complete system to the baseline. The dashed
curves in Figure 1 represent the baseline perfor-
mance with no clustering, no context ordering,
random sampling, and ALINE, unless otherwise
noted. In all plots, the error bars show the 99%

erage word length differs across languages, we re-
port the number of words along the x-axis. We
have verified that our system does not substantially
alter the average number of letters per word in the
training set for any of these languages. Hence, the

The idea of lowering the specificity of letter class ques-
tions as the context length increases is due to Kienappel and
Kneser (2001), and is intended to avoid overfitting. However,
their configuration differs from ours in that they use longer
context lengths (4 for German and 5 for English) and ask let-
ter class questions at every position. Essentially, the authors

problem, whereas we seek a more general representation that
will perform well on a variety of languages.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496833333333">
Our context ordering strategy improved the ac-
curacy of the decision tree learner on every lan-
guage (see Figure 1a). Statistically significant im-
provements were realized on Dutch, French, and
German. Our expectation was that context order-
ing would be particularly helpful during the early
rounds of active learning, when there is a greater
risk of overfitting on the small training sets. For
some languages (notably, German and Spanish)
this was indeed the case; yet, for Dutch, context
ordering became more effective as the training set
increased in size.
It should be noted that our context ordering
strategy is sufficiently general that it can be im-
plemented in other decision tree learners that grow
binary trees, such as Wagon/CART (Taylor et al.,
1998). An n-ary implementation is also feasible,
although we have not tried this variation.

As can be seen in Figure 1b, clustering letters into
classes tended to produce a steady increase in ac-
curacy. The only case where it had no statistically
significant effect was on English. Another benefit
of clustering is that it reduces variance. The confi-
dence intervals are generally wider when cluster-
ing is disabled, meaning that the systems perfor-
mance was less sensitive to changes in the initial
training set when letter classes were used.

The ALINE method for L2P alignment outper-
formed EM on all six datasets (see Figure 1d). As
was mentioned in Section 6, the EM aligner de-
pends on all the available training data, whereas
ALINE processes words individually. Only on
Spanish and Italian, languages which have highly
regular spelling systems, was the EM aligner com-
petitive with ALINE. The accuracy gains on the
remaining four datasets are remarkable, consider-
ing that better alignments do not necessarily trans-
late into improved classification.
We hypothesized that EMs inferior perfor-
mance was due to the limited quantities of data
that were available in the early stages of active
learning. In a follow-up experiment, we allowed
EM to align the entire learning set in advance,
and these aligned entries were revealed when re-
quested by the learner. We compared this with the
usual procedure whereby EM is applied to the la-
belled training data at each iteration of learning.
The learning curves (not shown) were virtually in-
distinguishable, and there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences on any of the languages. EM
appears to produce poor alignments regardless of
the amount of available data.

The complete system consists of context order-

the baseline represents random sampling with EM
alignment and no additional enhancements. Fig-
ure 2 plots the word accuracies for all six datasets.
Although the absolute word accuracies varied
considerably across the different languages, our
system significantly outperformed the baseline in
every instance. On the French dataset, for ex-
ample, the baseline labelled 1850 words before
reaching its maximum accuracy of 64%, whereas
the complete system required only 480 queries to
reach 64% accuracy. This represents a reduction
of 74% in the labelling effort. The savings for the
other languages are: Spanish, 75%; Dutch, 68%;
English, 59%; German, 59%; and Italian, 52%.6
Interestingly, the savings are the highest on Span-
ish, even though the corresponding accuracy gains
are the smallest. This demonstrates that our ap-
proach is also effective on languages with rela-
tively transparent orthography.
At first glance, the performance of both sys-
tems appears to be rather poor on the English
dataset. To put our results into perspective, Black
et al. (1998) report 57.8% accuracy on this dataset
with a similar alignment method and decision tree

9 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873130434783">
We have presented a system for learning a letter-
to-phoneme classifier that combines four distinct
enhancements in order to minimize the amount
of data that must be annotated. Our experiments
involving datasets from several languages clearly
demonstrate that unlabelled data can be used more
efficiently, resulting in greater accuracy for a given
training set size, without any additional tuning
for the different languages. The experiments also
show that a phonetically-based aligner may be
preferable to the widely-used EM alignment tech-
nique, a discovery that could lead to the improve-
ment of L2P accuracy in general.
While this work represents an important step
in reducing the cost of constructing an L2P train-
ing set, we intend to explore other active learners
and classification algorithms, including sequence
labelling strategies (Settles and Craven, 2008).
We also plan to incorporate user-centric enhance-
ments (Davel and Barnard, 2004; Culotta and Mc-
Callum, 2005) with the aim of reducing both the
effort and expertise that is required to annotate
words with their phoneme sequences.

<abstract confidence="0.994499">Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion is the process of producing a correct phoneme sequence for a word, given its letters. It is often desirable to reduce the quantity of training data and hence human annotation that is needed to train an L2P classifier for a new language. In this paper, we confront the challenge of building an accurate L2P classifier with a minimal amount of training data by combining several diverse techniques: context ordering, letter clustering, active learning, and phonetic L2P alignment. Experiments on six languages show up to 75% reduction in annotation effort.</abstract>

The latter attempts to select its training set intelligently by requesting the labels of only those examples that are judged to be the most useful or informative. Numerous studies have demonstrated that active learners can make more efficient use of unlabelled data than do passive learners (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998; Miller et al., 2004; Culotta and McCallum, 2005). However, relatively few researchers have applied active learning techniques to the L2P domain. This is despite the fact that annotated data for training an L2P classifier is not available in most languages. We briefly review two relevant studies before proceeding to describe our active learning strategy. Maskey et al. (2004) propose a bootstrapping technique that iteratively requests the labels of the n most frequent words in a corpus. A classifier is trained on the words that have been annotated thus far, and then predicts the phonemes for e</context>
<context position="15123" citStr="Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998" startWordPosition="2494" endWordPosition="2497">y a human annotator. The main drawback of such an approach lies in the risk of adding erroneous entries to the lexicon when the classifier is overly confident in a prediction. Kominek and Black (2006) devise a word selection strategy based on letter n-gram coverage and word length. Their method slightly outperforms random selection, thereby establishing passive learning as a strong baseline. However, only a single Italian dataset was used, and the results do not necessarily generalize to other languages. In this paper, we propose to apply an active learning technique known as Query-byBagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998). We consider a pool-based active learning setting, whereby the learner has access to a pool of unlabelled examples (words), and may obtain labels (phoneme sequences) at a cost. This is an iterative procedure in which the learner trains a classifier on the current set of labelled training data, then selects one or more new examples to label, according to the classifiers predictions on the pool data. Once labelled, these examples are added to the training set, the classifier is re-trained, and the process repeats until some stopping criterion is met (e.g., annotation resources are exhausted).

Finally, Section 9 offers some concluding remarks. 2 Decision tree learning of L2P classifiers In this work, we employ a decision tree model to learn the mapping from words to phoneme sequences. Decision tree learners are attractive because they are relatively fast to train, require little or no parameter tuning, and the resulting classifier can be interpreted by the user. A number of prior studies have applied decision trees to L2P data and have reported good generalization accuracy (Andersen et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001). Also, the widely-used Festival Speech Synthesis System (Taylor et al., 1998) relies on decision trees for L2P conversion. We adopt the standard approach of using the letter context as features. The decision tree predicts the phoneme for the focus letter based on the m letters that appear before and after it in the word (including the focus letter itself, and beginning/end of word markers, where applicable). The model predicts a phoneme independently for each letter in a given word. In order to keep our model simple and transparent, we do not e</context>

An accurate L2P converter is an important component of a text-to-speech system. In general, a lookup table does not suffice for L2P conversion, since out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., proper names) are inevitably encountered. This motivates the need for classification techniques that can predict the phonemes for an unseen word. Numerous studies have contributed to the development of increasingly accurate L2P systems (Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Bisani and Ney, 2002; Demberg et al., 2007; Jiampojamarn et al., 2008). A common assumption made in these works is that ample amounts of labelled data are available for training a classifier. Yet, in practice, this is the case for only a small number of languages. In order to train an L2P classifier for a new language, we must first annotate words in that language with their correct phoneme sequences.

In general, a lookup table does not suffice for L2P conversion, since out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., proper names) are inevitably encountered. This motivates the need for classification techniques that can predict the phonemes for an unseen word. Numerous studies have contributed to the development of increasingly accurate L2P systems (Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Bisani and Ney, 2002; Demberg et al., 2007; Jiampojamarn et al., 2008). A common assumption made in these works is that ample amounts of labelled data are available for training a classifier. Yet, in practice, this is the case for only a small number of languages. In order to train an L2P classifier for a new language, we must first annotate words in that language with their correct phoneme sequences.

Finally, Section 9 offers some concluding remarks. 2 Decision tree learning of L2P classifiers In this work, we employ a decision tree model to learn the mapping from words to phoneme sequences. Decision tree learners are attractive because they are relatively fast to train, require little or no parameter tuning, and the resulting classifier can be interpreted by the user. A number of prior studies have applied decision trees to L2P data and have reported good generalization accuracy (Andersen et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001). Also, the widely-used Festival Speech Synthesis System (Taylor et al., 1998) relies on decision trees for L2P conversion. We adopt the standard approach of using the letter context as features. The decision tree predicts the phoneme for the focus letter based on the m letters that appear before and after it in the word (including the focus letter itself, and beginning/end of word markers, where applicable). The model predicts a phoneme independently for each letter in a given word. In order to keep our model simple and transparent, we do not explore the possibili</context>

At first glance, the performance of both systems appears to be rather poor on the English dataset. To put our results into perspective, Black et al.

In addition to exploring the effect of letter clustering on a wider range of languages, we are particularly concerned with the impact that clustering has on decision tree performance when the training set is small. The addition of letter class features to the data may enable the active learner to better evaluate candidate words in the pool, and therefore make more informed selections. To group the letters into classes, we employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992). One advantage of inducing a hierarchy is that we need not commit to a particular level of granularity; in other words, we are not required to specify the number of classes beforehand, as is the case with some other clustering algorithms.1 The clustering algorithm is initialized by placing each letter in its own class, and then proceeds in a bottom-up manner. At each step, the pair of classes is merged that leads to the smallest loss in the average mutual information (Manning and Schutze, 1999) between adjacent classes.

A crucial question is how to calculate the disagreement among the predicted phoneme sequences for a word in the pool. In the L2P domain, we assume that a human annotator specifies the phonemes for an entire word, and that the active learner cannot query individual letters. We require a measure of confidence at the word level; yet, our classifiers make predictions at the letter level. This is analogous to the task of estimating record confidence using field confidence scores in information extraction (Culotta and McCallum, 2004). Our solution is as follows. Let w be a word in the pool. Each classifier Ci predicts the phoneme for each letter l w. These votes are aggregated to produce a vector vl for letter l that indicates the distribution of the |C |predictions over its possible phonemes. We then compute the margin for each letter: If {p, p0} vl are the two highest vote totals, then the margin is M(vl) = |p p0|. A small margin indicates disagreement among the constituent classifiers.

As a result, it will sometimes query a letter at position +3 (denoted l3), for example, before examining the letters that are closer to the center of the context window. We propose to modify the tree-growing procedure to encourage the selection of letters near the focus letter before those at greater offsets are examined. In its strictest form, which resembles the dynamically expanding context search strategy of Davel and Barnard (2004), li can only be queried after l0, . . . , li1 have been queried. However, this approach seems overly rigid for L2P. In English, for example, l2 can directly influence the pronunciation of a vowel regardless of the value of l1 (c.f., the difference between rid and ride). Instead, we adopt a less intrusive strategy, which we refer to as context ordering, that biases the decision tree toward letters that are closer to the focus, but permits gaps when the information gain for a distant letter is relatively high.

The standard approach to L2P alignment is described by Damper et al. (2005). It performs an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure that takes a (preferably large) collection of words as input and computes alignments for them simultaneously. However, since in our active learning setting the data is acquired incrementally, we cannot count on the initial availability of a substantial set of words accompanied by their phonemic transcriptions. In this paper, we apply the ALINE algorithm to the task of L2P alignment (Kondrak, 2000; Inkpen et al., 2007). ALINE, which performs phonetically-informed alignment of two strings of phonemes, requires no training data, and so is ideal for our purposes. Since our task requires the alignment of phonemes with letters, we wish to replace every letter with a phoneme that is the most likely to be produced by that letter. On the other hand, we would like our approach to be languageindependent. Our solution is to simply treat every letter as an IPA symbol (International Phonetic Association, 1999). The IPA is based on the Roman alphabet, but also includes a number of other symbols. The 26 IPA letter symbols</context>

An accurate L2P converter is an important component of a text-to-speech system. In general, a lookup table does not suffice for L2P conversion, since out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., proper names) are inevitably encountered. This motivates the need for classification techniques that can predict the phonemes for an unseen word. Numerous studies have contributed to the development of increasingly accurate L2P systems (Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Bisani and Ney, 2002; Demberg et al., 2007; Jiampojamarn et al., 2008).

Finally, Section 9 offers some concluding remarks. 2 Decision tree learning of L2P classifiers In this work, we employ a decision tree model to learn the mapping from words to phoneme sequences. Decision tree learners are attractive because they are relatively fast to train, require little or no parameter tuning, and the resulting classifier can be interpreted by the user. A number of prior studies have applied decision trees to L2P data and have reported good generalization accuracy (Andersen et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001). Also, the widely-used Festival Speech Synthesis System (Taylor et al., 1998) relies on decision trees for L2P conversion. We adopt the standard approach of using the letter context as features. The decision tree predicts the phoneme for the focus letter based on the m letters that appear before and after it in the word (including the focus letter itself, and beginning/end of word markers, where applicable). The model predicts a phoneme independently for each letter in a given word. In order to keep our model simple and transparent, we do not explore the possibility of conditioning on adjacen</context>

This means that a letter with above-average gain that is eligible with respect to the ordering will take precedence over an ineligible letter that has an even higher gain. However, if all the eligible letters have below-average gain, the ineligible letter with the highest gain is selected irrespective of its position. Our only strict requirement is that the focus letter must always be queried first, unless its information gain is zero. Kienappel and Kneser (2001) also worked on improving decision tree performance for L2P, and devised tie-breaking rules in the event that the treegrowing procedure ranked two or more questions as being equally informative. In our experience with L2P datasets, exact ties are rare; our context ordering mechanism will have more opportunities to guide the tree-growing process. We expect this change to improve accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is very limited. By biasing the decision tree learner toward questions that are intuitively of greater utility, we make it less prone to overfitting on small data sa</context>

That is, instead of treating letters as abstract symbols, we would like to encode knowledge of the similarity between certain letters as features. One way of achieving this goal is to group the letters into classes or clusters based on their contextual similarity. Then, when a prediction has to be made for an unseen (or low probability) letter sequence, the letter classes can provide additional information. Kienappel and Kneser (2001) report accuracy gains when applying letter clustering to the L2P task. However, their decision tree learner incorporates neighboring phoneme predictions, and employs a variety of different pruning strategies; the portion of the gains attributable to letter clustering are not evident. In addition to exploring the effect of letter clustering on a wider range of languages, we are particularly concerned with the impact that clustering has on decision tree performance when the training set is small. The addition of letter class features to the data may enable the active learner to better evaluate </context>

We have verified that our system does not substantially alter the average number of letters per word in the training set for any of these languages. Hence, the number of words reported here is representative of the true annotation effort. 4 Subtree raising is an expensive pruning operation that had a negligible impact on accuracy during preliminary experiments. Our pruning performs subtree replacement only. 5 The idea of lowering the specificity of letter class questions as the context length increases is due to Kienappel and Kneser (2001), and is intended to avoid overfitting. However, their configuration differs from ours in that they use longer context lengths (4 for German and 5 for English) and ask letter class questions at every position. Essentially, the authors tuned the feature set in order to optimize performance on each problem, whereas we seek a more general representation that will perform well on a variety of languages. 8.1 Context ordering Our context ordering strategy improved the accuracy of the decision tree learner on every language (see Figure 1a).

A classifier is trained on the words that have been annotated thus far, and then predicts the phonemes for each of the n words being considered. Words for which the prediction confidence is above a certain threshold are immediately added to the lexicon, while the remaining words must be verified (and corrected, if necessary) by a human annotator. The main drawback of such an approach lies in the risk of adding erroneous entries to the lexicon when the classifier is overly confident in a prediction. Kominek and Black (2006) devise a word selection strategy based on letter n-gram coverage and word length. Their method slightly outperforms random selection, thereby establishing passive learning as a strong baseline. However, only a single Italian dataset was used, and the results do not necessarily generalize to other languages. In this paper, we propose to apply an active learning technique known as Query-byBagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998). We consider a pool-based active learning setting, whereby the learner has access to a pool of unlabelled examples (words), and may obtain labels (phoneme sequences) at a cost</context>

The standard approach to L2P alignment is described by Damper et al. (2005). It performs an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure that takes a (preferably large) collection of words as input and computes alignments for them simultaneously. However, since in our active learning setting the data is acquired incrementally, we cannot count on the initial availability of a substantial set of words accompanied by their phonemic transcriptions. In this paper, we apply the ALINE algorithm to the task of L2P alignment (Kondrak, 2000; Inkpen et al., 2007). ALINE, which performs phonetically-informed alignment of two strings of phonemes, requires no training data, and so is ideal for our purposes. Since our task requires the alignment of phonemes with letters, we wish to replace every letter with a phoneme that is the most likely to be produced by that letter. On the other hand, we would like our approach to be languageindependent. Our solution is to simply treat every letter as an IPA symbol (International Phonetic Association, 1999). The IPA is based on the Roman alphabet, but also includes a number of other symbols. The</context>

In the forthcoming experiments, we use binary decision trees exclusively. 3 Context ordering In the L2P task, context letters that are adjacent to the focus letter tend to be more important than context letters that are further away. For example, the English letter c is usually pronounced as [s] if the following letter is e or i. The general tree-growing algorithm has no notion of the letter distance, but instead chooses the letters on the basis of their estimated information gain (Manning and Schutze, 1999). As a result, it will sometimes query a letter at position +3 (denoted l3), for example, before examining the letters that are closer to the center of the context window. We propose to modify the tree-growing procedure to encourage the selection of letters near the focus letter before those at greater offsets are examined. In its strictest form, which resembles the dynamically expanding context search strategy of Davel and Barnard (2004), li can only be queried after l0, . . . , li1 have been queried. However, this approach seems overly rigid for L2P. In English, for example, l2 can directly </context>

To group the letters into classes, we employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992). One advantage of inducing a hierarchy is that we need not commit to a particular level of granularity; in other words, we are not required to specify the number of classes beforehand, as is the case with some other clustering algorithms.1 The clustering algorithm is initialized by placing each letter in its own class, and then proceeds in a bottom-up manner. At each step, the pair of classes is merged that leads to the smallest loss in the average mutual information (Manning and Schutze, 1999) between adjacent classes. The merging process repeats until a single class remains that contains all the letters in the alphabet.

The latter attempts to select its training set intelligently by requesting the labels of only those examples that are judged to be the most useful or informative. Numerous studies have demonstrated that active learners can make more efficient use of unlabelled data than do passive learners (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998; Miller et al., 2004; Culotta and McCallum, 2005). However, relatively few researchers have applied active learning techniques to the L2P domain. This is despite the fact that annotated data for training an L2P classifier is not available in most languages.

Our expectation was that context ordering would be particularly helpful during the early rounds of active learning, when there is a greater risk of overfitting on the small training sets. For some languages (notably, German and Spanish) this was indeed the case; yet, for Dutch, context ordering became more effective as the training set increased in size. It should be noted that our context ordering strategy is sufficiently general that it can be implemented in other decision tree learners that grow binary trees, such as Wagon/CART (Taylor et al., 1998). An n-ary implementation is also feasible, although we have not tried this variation. 8.2 Clustering letters As can be seen in Figure 1b, clustering letters into classes tended to produce a steady increase in accuracy. The only case where it had no statistically significant effect was on English. Another benefit of clustering is that it reduces variance. The confidence intervals are generally wider when clustering is disabled, meaning that the systems performance was less sensitive to changes in the initial training set when letter classes were used. 8.3 Active learning On five of the six dat</context>

Note that although we query examples using a committee, we train a single tree on these examples in order to produce an intelligible model. Prior work has demonstrated that this configuration performs well in practice (Dwyer and Holte, 2007). Our results report the accuracy of the single tree grown on each iteration, averaged 3 Available at http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Challenges/ PRONALSYL/Datasets/ 131 \x0cover 10 random draws of the initial training set. For our decision tree learner, we utilized the J48 algorithm provided by Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). We also experimented with Wagon (Taylor et al., 1998), an implementation of CART, but J48 performed better during preliminary trials. We ran J48 with default parameter settings, except that binary trees were grown (see Section 2), and subtree raising was disabled.4 Our feature template was established during development set experiments with the English CMU data; the data from the other five languages did not influence these choices. The letter context consisted of the focus letter and the 3 letters appearing before and after the focus (or beginning/end of word markers, where applicable). For</context>
