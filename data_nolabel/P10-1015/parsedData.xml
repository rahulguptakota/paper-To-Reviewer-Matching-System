We present a method for extracting so-
cial networks from literature, namely,
nineteenth-century British novels and se-
rials. We derive the networks from di-
alogue interactions, and thus our method
depends on the ability to determine when
two characters are in conversation. Our
approach involves character name chunk-
ing, quoted speech attribution and conver-
sation detection given the set of quotes.
We extract features from the social net-
works and examine their correlation with
one another, as well as with metadata such
as the novels setting. Our results provide
evidence that the majority of novels in this
time period do not fit two characterizations
provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our
results suggest an alternative explanation
for differences in social networks.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998665983050848">
Literary studies about the nineteenth-century
British novel are often concerned with the nature
of the community that surrounds the protagonist.
Some theorists have suggested a relationship be-
tween the size of a community and the amount of
dialogue that occurs, positing that face to face
time diminishes as the number of characters in
the novel grows. Others suggest that as the social
setting becomes more urbanized, the quality of di-
alogue also changes, with more interactions occur-
ring in rural communities than urban communities.
Such claims have typically been made, however,
on the basis of a few novels that are studied in
depth. In this paper, we aim to determine whether
an automated study of a much larger sample of
nineteenth century novels supports these claims.
The research presented here is concerned with
the extraction of social networks from literature.
We present a method to automatically construct
a network based on dialogue interactions between
characters in a novel. Our approach includes com-
ponents for finding instances of quoted speech,
attributing each quote to a character, and iden-
tifying when certain characters are in conversa-
tion. We then construct a network where char-
acters are vertices and edges signify an amount
of bilateral conversation between those charac-
ters, with edge weights corresponding to the fre-
quency and length of their exchanges. In contrast
to previous approaches to social network construc-
tion, ours relies on a novel combination of pattern-
based detection, statistical methods, and adapta-
tion of standard natural language tools for the liter-
ary genre. We carried out this work on a corpus of
60 nineteenth-century novels and serials, includ-
ing 31 authors such as Dickens, Austen and Conan
Doyle.
In order to evaluate the literary claims in ques-
tion, we compute various characteristics of the
dialogue-based social network and stratify these
results by categories such as the novels setting.
For example, the density of the network provides
evidence about the cohesion of a large or small
community, and cliques may indicate a social frag-
mentation. Our results surprisingly provide evi-
dence that the majority of novels in this time pe-
riod do not fit the suggestions provided by liter-
ary scholars, and we suggest an alternative expla-
nation for our observations of differences across
novels.
In the following sections, we survey related
work on social networks as well as computational
studies of literature. We then present the literary
hypotheses in more detail. We describe the meth-
ods we use to extract dialogue and construct con-
versational networks, along with our approach to
analyzing their characteristics. After we present
the statistical results, we analyze their significance
from a literary perspective.

Computer-assisted literary analysis has typically
occurred at the word level. This level of granular-
ity lends itself to studies of authorial style based
on patterns of word use (Burrows, 2004), and re-
searchers have successfully outed the writers of
anonymous texts by comparing their style to that
of a corpus of known authors (Mostellar and Wal-
lace, 1984). Determining instances of text reuse,
a type of paraphrasing, is also a form of analysis
at the lexical level, and it has recently been used to
validate theories about the lineage of ancient texts
(Lee, 2007).
Analysis of literature using more semantically-
oriented techniques has been rare, most likely be-
cause of the difficulty in automatically determin-
ing meaningful interpretations. Some exceptions
include recent work on learning common event se-
quences in news stories (Chambers and Jurafsky,
2008), an approach based on statistical methods,
and the development of an event calculus for char-
acterizing stories written by children (Halpin et al.,
2004), a knowledge-based strategy. On the other
hand, literary theorists, linguists and others have
long developed symbolic but non-computational
models for novels. For example, Moretti (2005)
has graphically mapped out texts according to ge-
ography, social connections and other variables.
While researchers have not attempted the auto-
matic construction of social networks represent-
ing connections between characters in a corpus
of novels, the ACE program has involved entity
and relation extraction in unstructured text (Dod-
dington et al., 2004). Other recent work in so-
cial network construction has explored the use of
structured data such as email headers (McCallum
et al., 2007) and U.S. Senate bill cosponsorship
(Cho and Fowler, 2010). In an analysis of discus-
sion forums, Gruzd and Haythornthwaite (2008)
explored the use of message text as well as posting
data to infer who is talking to whom. In this pa-
per, we also explore how to build a network based
on conversational interaction, but we analyze the
reported dialogue found in novels to determine the
links. The kinds of language that is used to signal
such information is quite different in the two me-
dia. In discussion forums, people tend to use ad-
dresses such as Hi Tom, while in novels, a sys-
tem must determine both the speaker of a quota-
tion and then the intended recipient of the dialogue
act. This is a significantly different problem.

3 Hypotheses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99927456">
It is commonly held that the novel is a literary
form which tries to produce an accurate represen-
tation of the social world. Within literary stud-
ies, the recurring problem is how that represen-
tation is achieved. Theories about the relation
between novelistic form (the workings of plot,
characters, and dialogue, to take the most basic
categories) and changes to real-world social mi-
lieux abound. Many of these theories center on
nineteenth-century European fiction; innovations
in novelistic form during this period, as well as the
rapid social changes brought about by revolution,
industrialization, and transport development, have
traditionally been linked. These theories, however,
have used only a select few representative novels
as proof. By using statistical methods of analy-
sis, it is possible to move beyond this small corpus
of proof texts. We believe these methods are es-
sential to testing the validity of some core theories
about social interaction and their representation in
literary genres like the novel.
Major versions of the theories about the social
worlds of nineteenth-century fiction tend to cen-
ter on characters, in two specific ways: how many
characters novels tend to have, and how those
characters interact with one another. These two
formal facts about novels are usually explained
with reference to a novels setting. From the influ-
ential work of the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin
to the present, a consensus emerged that as nov-
els are increasingly set in urban areas, the num-
ber of characters and the quality of their interac-
tion change to suit the setting. Bakhtins term for
this causal relationship was chronotope: the in-
trinsic interconnectedness of temporal and spatial
relationships that are artistically expressed in liter-
ature, in which space becomes charged and re-
sponsive to movements of time, plot, and history
(Bakhtin, 1981, 84). In Bakhtins analysis, dif-
ferent spaces have different social and emotional
potentialities, which in turn affect the most basic
aspects of a novels aesthetic technique.
After Bakhtins invention of the chronotope,
much literary criticism and theory devoted itself
to filling in, or describing, the qualities of spe-
cific chronotopes, particularly those of the village
or rural environment and the city or urban en-
vironment. Following a suggestion of Bakhtins
that the population of village or rural fictions is
modeled on the world of the family, made up of

an intimately related set of characters, many crit-
ics analyzed the formal expression of this world
as constituted by a small set of characters who
express themselves conversationally. Raymond
Williams used the term knowable communities
to describe this world, in which face-to-face rela-
tions of a restricted set of characters are the pri-
mary mode of social interaction (Williams, 1975,
166).
By contrast, the urban world, in this traditional
account, is both larger and more complex. To
describe the social-psychological impact of the
city, Franco Moretti argues, protagonists of urban
novels change overnight from sons into young
men: their affective ties are no longer vertical
ones (between successive generations), but hor-
izontal, within the same generation. They are
drawn towards those unknown yet congenial faces
seen in gardens, or at the theater; future friends,
or rivals, or both (Moretti, 1999, 65). The re-
sult is two-fold: more characters, indeed a mass
of characters, and more interactions, although less
actual conversation; as literary critic Terry Eagle-
ton argues, the city is where most of our en-
counters consist of seeing rather than speaking,
glimpsing each other as objects rather than con-
versing as fellow subjects (Eagleton, 2005, 145).
Moretti argues in similar terms. For him, the
difference in number of characters is not just a
matter of quantity... its a qualitative, morpho-
logical one (Moretti, 1999, 68). As the number
of characters increases, Moretti argues (following
Bakhtin in his logic), social interactions of differ-
ent kinds and durations multiply, displacing the
family-centered and conversational logic of vil-
lage or rural fictions. The narrative system be-
comes complicated, unstable: the city turns into a
gigantic roulette table, where helpers and antago-
nists mix in unpredictable combinations (Moretti,
1999, 68). This argument about how novelistic
setting produces different forms of social interac-
tion is precisely what our method seeks to evalu-
ate.
Our corpus of 60 novels was selected for its rep-
resentativeness, particularly in the following cate-
gories: authorial (novels from the major canoni-

\x0ccal authors of the period), historical (novels from
each decade), generic (from the major sub-genres
of nineteenth-century fiction), sociological (set in
rural, urban, and mixed locales), and technical
(narrated in first-person and third-person form).
The novels, as well as important metadata we as-
signed to them (the perspective and setting), are
shown in Table 1. We define urban to mean set
in a metropolitan zone, characterized by multi-
ple forms of labor (not just agricultural). Here,
social relations are largely financial or commer-
cial in character. We conversely define rural to
describe texts that are set in a country or vil-
lage zone, where agriculture is the primary activ-
ity, and where land-owning, non-productive, rent-
collecting gentry are socially predominant. Social
relations here are still modeled on feudalism (rela-
tions of peasant-lord loyalty and family tie) rather
than the commercial cash nexus. We also explored
other properties of the texts, such as literary genre,
but focus on the results found with setting and per-
spective. We obtained electronic encodings of the
texts from Project Gutenberg. All told, these texts
total more than 10 million words.
We assembled this representative corpus in or-
der to test two hypotheses, which are derived from
the aforementioned theories:
1. That there is an inverse correlation between
the amount of dialogue in a novel and the
number of characters in that novel. One ba-
sic, shared assumption of these theorists is
that as the network of characters expands
as, in Morettis words, a quantitative change
becomes qualitative the importance, and in
fact amount, of dialogue decreases. With
a method for extracting conversation from a
large corpus of texts, it is possible to test this
hypothesis against a wide range of data.
2. That a significant difference in the
nineteenth-century novels representation of
social interaction is geographical: novels set
in urban environments depict a complex but
loose social network, in which numerous
characters share little conversational interac-
tion, while novels set in rural environments
inhabit more tightly bound social networks,
with fewer characters sharing much more
conversational interaction. This hypothesis
is based on the contrast between Williamss
rural knowable communities and the
sprawling, populous, less conversational
urban fictions or Morettis and Eagletons
analyses. If true, it would suggest that the
inverse relationship of hypothesis #1 (more
characters means less conversation) can be
correlated to, and perhaps even caused by,
the geography of a novels setting. The
claims about novelistic geography and social
interaction have usually been based on
comparisons of a selected few novelists (Jane
Austen and Charles Dickens preeminently).
Do they remain valid when tested against a
larger corpus?

4 Extracting Conversational Networks

from Literature
In order to test these hypotheses, we developed
a novel approach to extracting social networks
from literary texts themselves, building on exist-
ing analysis tools. We defined social network
as conversational network for purposes of eval-
uating these literary theories. In a conversational
network, vertices represent characters (assumed to
be named entities) and edges indicate at least one
instance of dialogue interaction between two char-
acters over the course of the novel. The weight of
each edge is proportional to the amount of inter-
action. We define a conversation as a continuous
span of narrative time featuring a set of characters
in which the following conditions are met:

other and each characters speech is mutually
intended for the other to hear.
In the following subsections, we discuss the
methods we devised for the three problems in text
processing invoked by this approach: identifying
the characters present in a literary text, assigning
a speaker (if any) to each instance of quoted
speech from among those characters, and con-
structing a social network by detecting conversa-
tions from the set of dialogue acts.

\x0cwith the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005)
and extracted noun phrases that were categorized
as persons or organizations. We then clustered the
noun phrases into coreferents for the same entity
(person or organization). The clustering process is
as follows:
1. For each named entity, we generate varia-
tions on the name that we would expect to
see in a coreferent. Each variation omits cer-
tain parts of multi-word names, respecting ti-
tles and first/last name distinctions, similar to
work by Davis et al. (2003). For example,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes may refer to the same
character as Mr. Holmes, Sherlock Holmes,
Sherlock and Holmes.
2. For each named entity, we compile a list of
other named entities that may be coreferents,
either because they are identical or because
one is an expected variation on the other.
3. We then match each named entity to the most
recent of its possible coreferents. In aggre-
gate, this creates a cluster of mentions for
each character.
We also pre-processed the texts to normalize
formatting, detect headings and chapter breaks, re-
move metadata, and identify likely instances of
quoted speech (that is, mark up spans of text that
fall between quotation marks, assumed to be a su-
perset of the quoted speech present in the text).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995">
4.2 Quoted Speech Attribution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999446037037037">
In order to programmatically assign a speaker to
each instance of quoted speech, we applied a high-
precision subset of a general approach we describe
elsewhere (Elson and McKeown, 2010). The first
step of this approach was to compile a separate
training and testing corpus of literary texts from
British, American and Russian authors of the nine-
teenth and twentieth centuries. The training cor-
pus consisted of about 111,000 words including
3,176 instances of quoted speech. To obtain gold-
standard annotations, we conducted an online sur-
vey via Amazons Mechanical Turk program. For
each quote, we asked three annotators to indepen-
dently choose a speaker from the list of contex-
tual candidates or, choose spoken by an unlisted
character if the answer was not available, or not
spoken by any character for non-dialogue cases
such as sneer quotes.
We divided this corpus into training and testing
sets, and used the training set to develop a catego-
rizer that assigned one of five syntactic categories
to each quote. For example, if a quote is followed
by a verb that indicates verbal expression (such as
said), and then a character mention, a category
called Character trigram is assigned to the quote.
The fifth category is a catch-all for quotes that do
not fall into the other four. In many cases, the an-
swer can be reliably determined based solely on
its syntactic category. For instance, in the Char-
acter trigram category, the mentioned character is
the quotes speaker in 99% of both the training and
testing sets.
In all, we were able to determine the speaker
of 57% of the testing set with 96% accuracy just
on the basis of syntactic categorization. This is
the technique we used to construct our conversa-
tional networks. In another study, we applied ma-
chine learning tools to the data (one model for
each syntactic category) and achieved an overall
accuracy of 83% over the entire test set (Elson
and McKeown, 2010). The other 43% of quotes
are left here as unknown speakers; however, in
the present study, we are interested in conversa-
tions rather than individual quotes. Each conversa-
tion is likely to consist of multiple quotes by each
speaker, increasing the chances of detecting the in-
teraction. Moreover, this design decision empha-
sizes the precision of the social networks over their
recall. This tilts in favor of hypothesis #1 (that
there are fewer social interactions in larger com-
munities); however, we shall see that despite the
emphasis of precision over recall, we identify a
sufficient mass of interactions in the texts to con-
stitute evidence against this hypothesis.

We then applied the results from our character
identification and quoted speech attribution meth-
ods toward the construction of conversational net-
works from literature. We derived one network
from each text in our corpus.
We first assigned vertices to character enti-
ties that are mentioned repeatedly throughout the
novel. Coreferents for the same name (such as
Mr. Darcy and Darcy) were grouped into the same
vertex. We found that a network that included in-
cidental or single-mention named entities became
too noisy to function effectively, so we filtered out
the entities that are mentioned fewer than three

\x0ctimes in the novel or are responsible for less than
1% of the named entity mentions in the novel.
We assigned undirected edges between vertices
that represent adjacency in quoted speech frag-
ments. Specifically, we set the weight of each
undirected edge between two character vertices to
the total length, in words, of all quotes that either
character speaks from among all pairs of adjacent
quotes in which they both speak implying face to
face conversation. We empirically determined that
the most accurate definition of adjacency is one
where the two characters quotes fall within 300
words of one another with no attributed quotes in
between. When such an adjacency is found, the
length of the quote is added to the edge weight,
under the hypothesis that the significance of the re-
lationship between two individuals is proportional
to the length of the dialogue that they exchange.
Finally, we normalized each edges weight by the
length of the novel.
An example network, automatically constructed
in this manner from Jane Austens Mansfield Park,
is shown in Figure 1. The width of each vertex is
drawn to be proportional to the characters share
of all the named entity mentions in the book (so
that protagonists, who are mentioned frequently,
appear in larger ovals). The width of each edge is
drawn to be proportional to its weight (total con-
versation length).
We also experimented with two alternate meth-
ods for identifying edges, for purposes of a base-
line:
1. The correlation method divides the text
into 10-paragraph segments and counts the
number of mentions of each character in
each segment (excluding mentions inside
quoted speech). It then computes the Pear-
son product-moment correlation coefficient
for the distributions of mentions for each pair
of characters. These coefficients are used for
the edge weights. Characters that tend to ap-
pear together in the same areas of the novel
are taken to be more socially connected, and
have a higher edge weight.
2. The spoken mention method counts occur-
rences when one character refers to another
in his or her quoted speech. These counts,
normalized by the length of the text, are used
as edge weights. The intuition is that charac-
ters who refer to one another are likely to be
in conversation.

4.4 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998316642857143">
To check the accuracy of our method for extracting
conversational networks, we conducted an evalua-
tion involving four of the novels (The Sign of the
Four, Emma, David Copperfield and The Portrait
of a Lady). We did not use these texts when devel-
oping our method for identifying conversations.
For each book, we randomly selected 4-5 chap-
ters from among those with significant amounts
of quoted speech, so that all excerpts from each
novel amounted to at least 10,000 words. We then
asked three annotators to identity all the conversa-
tions that occur in all 44,000 words. We requested
that the annotators include both direct and indi-
rect (unquoted) speech, and define conversation
as in the beginning of Section 4, but exclude re-
told conversations (those that occur within other
dialogue).
We processed the annotation results by breaking
down each multi-way conversation into all of its
unique two-character interactions (for example, a
conversation between four people indicates six bi-
lateral interactions). To calculate inter-annotator
agreement, we first compiled a list of all possi-

In this model, each annotator contributed a set of
yes or no decisions, one for every character
pair. We then applied the kappa measurement for
agreement in a binary classification problem (Co-

hen, 1960). In 95% of character pairs, annota-
tors were unanimous, which is a high agreement
of k = .82.
The precision and recall of our method for de-
tecting conversations is shown in Table 2. Preci-
sion was .95; this indicates that we can be con-
fident in the specificity of the conversational net-
works that we automatically construct. Recall was
.51, indicating a sensitivity of slightly more than
half. There were several reasons that we did not
detect the missing links, including indirect speech,
quotes attributed to anaphoras or coreferents, and
diffuse conversations in which the characters do
not speak in turn with one another.
To calculate precision and recall for the two
baseline social networks, we set a threshold t to
derive a binary prediction from the continuous
edge weights. The precision and recall values
shown for the baselines in Table 2 represent the
highest performance we achieved by varying t be-
tween 0 and 1 (maximizing F-measure over t).
Both baselines performed significantly worse in
precision and F-measure than our quoted speech
adjacency method for detecting conversations.

5.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999128043478261">
We derived results from the data in two ways.
First, we examined the strengths of the correla-
tions between the features that we extracted (for
example, between number of character vertices
and the average degree of each vertex). We used
Pearsons product-moment correlation coefficient
in these calculations. Second, we compared the
extracted features to the metadata we previously
assigned to each text (e.g., urban vs. rural).
Hypothesis #1, which we described in Section
3, claims that there is an inverse correlation be-
tween the amount of dialogue in a nineteenth-
century novel and the number of characters in that
novel. We did not find this to be the case. Rather,
we found a weak but positive correlation (r=.16)
between the number of quotes in a novel and
the number of characters (normalizing the quote
count for text length). There was a stronger pos-
itive correlation (r=.50) between the number of
unique speakers (those characters who speak at
least once) and the normalized number of quotes,
suggesting that larger networks have more conver-
sations than smaller ones. But because the first

<bodyText confidence="0.998985921568627">
\x0ccorrelation is weak, we investigated whether fur-
ther analysis could identify other evidence that
confirms or contradicts the hypothesis.
Another way to interpret hypothesis #1 is that
social networks with more characters tend to break
apart and be less connected. However, we found
the opposite to be true. The correlation between
the number of characters in each graph and the av-
erage degree (number of conversation partners) for
each character was a positive, moderately strong
r=.42. This is not a given; a network can easily, for
example, break into minimally connected or mutu-
ally exclusive subnetworks when more characters
are involved. Instead, we found that networks tend
to stay close-knit regardless of their size: even the
density of the graph (the percentage of the com-
munity that each character talks to) grows with
the total population size at r=.30. Moreover, as
the population of speakers grows, the density is
likely to increase at r=.49. A higher number of
characters (speaking or non-speaking) is also cor-
related with a higher rate of 3-cliques per charac-
ter (r=.38), as well as with a more balanced dis-
tribution of dialogue (the share of dialogue spo-
ken by the top three speakers decreases at r=.61).
This evidence suggests that in nineteenth-century
British literature, it is the small communities,
rather than the large ones, that tend to be discon-
nected.
Hypothesis #2, meanwhile, posited that a
novels setting (urban or rural) would have an ef-
fect on the structure of its social network. After
defining social network as a conversational net-
work, we did not find this to be the case. Sur-
prisingly, the numbers of characters and speakers
found in the urban novel were not significantly
greater than those found in the rural novel. More-
over, each of the features we extracted, such as
the rate of cliques, average degree, density, and
rate of characters mentions of other characters,
did not change in a statistically significant man-
ner between the two genres. For example, Figure
2 shows the mean over all texts of each networks
average degree, with confidence intervals, sepa-
rated by setting into urban and rural. The increase
in degree seen in urban texts is not significant.
Rather, the only type of metadata variable that
did impact the average degree with any signifi-
cance was the texts perspective. Figure 2 also sep-
arates texts into first- and third-person tellings and
shows the means and confidence intervals for the

person had much more connected networks than
stories told in the first person: not only did the av-
erage degree increase with statistical significance
(by the homoscedastic t-test to p &lt; .005), so too
did the graph density (p &lt; .05) and the rate of
3-cliques per character (p &lt; .05).
We believe the reason for this can be intuited
with a visual inspection of a first-person graph.
Figure 3 shows the conversational network ex-
tracted for Collinss The Woman in White, which is
told in the first person. Not surprisingly, the most
oft-repeated named entity in the text is I, referring
to the narrator. More surprising is the lack of con-
versation connections between the auxiliary char-
acters. The storys structure revolves around the
narrator and each character is understood in terms
of his or her relationship to the narrator. Private
conversations between auxiliary characters would
not include the narrator, and thus do not appear in a

narrator, by contrast, can eavesdrop on any pair
of characters conversing. This highlights the im-
portance of detecting reported and indirect speech
in future work, as a first-person narrator may hear
about other connections without witnessing them.

6 Literary Interpretation of Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999581093023255">
Our data, therefore, markedly do not confirm hy-
pothesis #1. They also suggest, in relation to hy-
pothesis #2 (also not confirmed by the data), a
strong reason why.
One of the basic assumptions behind hypoth-
esis #2 that urban novels contain more charac-
ters, mirroring the masses of nineteenth-century
cities is not borne out by our data. Our results do,
however, strongly correlate a point of view (third-
person narration) with more frequently connected
characters, implying tighter and more talkative so-
cial networks.
We would propose that this suggests that the
form of a given novel the standpoint of the nar-
rative voice, whether the voice is omniscient or
not is far more determinative of the kind of so-
cial network described in the novel than where it
is set or even the number of characters involved.
Whereas standard accounts of nineteenth-century
fiction, following Bakhtins notion of the chrono-
tope, emphasize the content of the novel as de-
terminative (where it is set, whether the novel fits
within a genre of village or urban fiction),
we have found that content to be surprisingly ir-
relevant to the shape of social networks within.
Bakhtins influential theory, and its detailed re-
workings by Williams, Moretti, and others, sug-
gests that as the novel becomes more urban, more
centered in (and interested in) populous urban set-
tings, the novels form changes to accommodate
the looser, more populated, less conversational
networks of city life. Our data suggests the op-
posite: that the urban novel is not as strongly
distinctive a form as has been asserted, and that in
fact it can look much like the village fictions of the
century, as long as the same method of narration is
used.
This conclusion leads to some further consider-
ations. We are suggesting that the important ele-
ment of social networks in nineteenth-century fic-
tion is not where the networks are set, but from
what standpoint they are imagined or narrated.
Narrative voice, that is, trumps setting.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999630666666667">
In this paper, we presented a method for char-
acterizing a text of literary fiction by extracting
the network of social conversations that occur be-
tween its characters. This allowed us to take a
systematic and wide look at a large corpus of
texts, an approach which complements the nar-
rower and deeper analysis performed by literary
scholars and can provide evidence for or against
some of their claims. In particular, we described
a high-precision method for detecting face-to-face
conversations between two named characters in a
novel, and showed that as the number of charac-
ters in a novel grows, so too do the cohesion, in-
terconnectedness and balance of their social net-
work. In addition, we showed that the form of the
novel (first- or third-person) is a stronger predictor
of these features than the setting (urban or rural).
Our results thus far suggest further review of our
methods, our corpus and our results for more in-
sights into the social networks found in this and
other genres of fiction.

<abstract confidence="0.998209">We present a method for extracting social networks from literature, namely, nineteenth-century British novels and serials. We derive the networks from dialogue interactions, and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves character name chunking, quoted speech attribution and conversation detection given the set of quotes. We extract features from the social networks and examine their correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as the novels setting. Our results provide evidence that the majority of novels in this time period do not fit two characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in social networks.</abstract>

From the influential work of the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin to the present, a consensus emerged that as novels are increasingly set in urban areas, the number of characters and the quality of their interaction change to suit the setting. Bakhtins term for this causal relationship was chronotope: the intrinsic interconnectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature, in which space becomes charged and responsive to movements of time, plot, and history (Bakhtin, 1981, 84). In Bakhtins analysis, different spaces have different social and emotional potentialities, which in turn affect the most basic aspects of a novels aesthetic technique. After Bakhtins invention of the chronotope, much literary criticism and theory devoted itself to filling in, or describing, the qualities of specific chronotopes, particularly those of the village or rural environment and the city or urban environment.

They are drawn towards those unknown yet congenial faces seen in gardens, or at the theater; future friends, or rivals, or both (Moretti, 1999, 65). The result is two-fold: more characters, indeed a mass of characters, and more interactions, although less actual conversation; as literary critic Terry Eagleton argues, the city is where most of our encounters consist of seeing rather than speaking, glimpsing each other as objects rather than conversing as fellow subjects (Eagleton, 2005, 145). Moretti argues in similar terms. For him, the difference in number of characters is not just a matter of quantity... its a qualitative, morphological one (Moretti, 1999, 68). As the number of characters increases, Moretti argues (following Bakhtin in his logic), social interactions of different kinds and durations multiply, displacing the family-centered and conversational logic of village or rural fictions. The narrative system becomes complicated, unstable: the city turns into a gigantic roulette table, where helpers and antagonists mix in unpredictable combinations (Moretti, 1999, 6</context>

In aggregate, this creates a cluster of mentions for each character. We also pre-processed the texts to normalize formatting, detect headings and chapter breaks, remove metadata, and identify likely instances of quoted speech (that is, mark up spans of text that fall between quotation marks, assumed to be a superset of the quoted speech present in the text). 4.2 Quoted Speech Attribution In order to programmatically assign a speaker to each instance of quoted speech, we applied a highprecision subset of a general approach we describe elsewhere (Elson and McKeown, 2010). The first step of this approach was to compile a separate training and testing corpus of literary texts from British, American and Russian authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The training corpus consisted of about 111,000 words including 3,176 instances of quoted speech. To obtain goldstandard annotations, we conducted an online survey via Amazons Mechanical Turk program. For each quote, we asked three annotators to independently choose a speaker from the list of contextual candidates or, choose spoken by an unlisted character if the answer was not available, or not spoken by </context>

For instance, in the Character trigram category, the mentioned character is the quotes speaker in 99% of both the training and testing sets. In all, we were able to determine the speaker of 57% of the testing set with 96% accuracy just on the basis of syntactic categorization. This is the technique we used to construct our conversational networks. In another study, we applied machine learning tools to the data (one model for each syntactic category) and achieved an overall accuracy of 83% over the entire test set (Elson and McKeown, 2010). The other 43% of quotes are left here as unknown speakers; however, in the present study, we are interested in conversations rather than individual quotes. Each conversation is likely to consist of multiple quotes by each speaker, increasing the chances of detecting the interaction. Moreover, this design decision emphasizes the precision of the social networks over their recall. This tilts in favor of hypothesis #1 (that there are fewer social interactions in larger communities); however, we shall see that despite the emphasis of precision over recall, we identify a sufficient mass of intera</context>

In the following subsections, we discuss the methods we devised for the three problems in text processing invoked by this approach: identifying the characters present in a literary text, assigning a speaker (if any) to each instance of quoted speech from among those characters, and constructing a social network by detecting conversations from the set of dialogue acts. 4.1 Character Identification The first challenge was to identify the candidate speakers by chunking names (such as Mr. Holmes) from the text. We processed each novel 141 \x0cwith the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) and extracted noun phrases that were categorized as persons or organizations.
