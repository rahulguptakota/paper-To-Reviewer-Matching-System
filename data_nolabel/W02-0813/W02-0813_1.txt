Abstract
In this paper we present a maximum en-
tropy Word Sense Disambiguation system
we developed which performs competi-
tively on SENSEVAL-2 test data for En-
glish verbs. We demonstrate that using
richer linguistic contextual features sig-
nificantly improves tagging accuracy, and
compare the systems performance with
human annotator performance in light
of both fine-grained and coarse-grained
sense distinctions made by the sense in-
ventory.
1 Introduction
Highly ambiguous words pose continuing problems
for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applica-
tions. They can lead to irrelevant document re-
trieval in IR systems, and inaccurate translations in
Machine Translation systems (Palmer et al., 2000).
While homonyms like bank are fairly tractable, pol-
ysemous words like run, with related but subtly dis-
tinct meanings, present the greatest hurdle for Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD). SENSEVAL-1 and
SENSEVAL-2 have attempted to provide a frame-
work for evaluating automatic systems by creating
corpora tagged with fixed sense inventories, which
also enables the training of supervised WSD sys-
tems.
In this paper we describe a maximum entropy
WSD system that combines information from many
different sources, using as much linguistic knowl-
edge as can be gathered automatically by current
NLP tools. Maximum entropy models have been
applied to a wide range of classification tasks in
NLP (Ratnaparkhi, 1998). Our maximum entropy
system performed competitively with the best per-
forming systems on the English verb lexical sample
task in SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2. We com-
pared the system performance with human annota-
tor performance in light of both fine-grained and
coarse-grained sense distinctions made by WordNet
in SENSEVAL-2, and found that many of the sys-
tems errors on fine-grained senses stemmed from
the same sources that caused disagreements between
human annotators. These differences were par-
tially resolved by backing off to more coarse-grained
sense-groups, which are sometimes necessary when
even human annotators cannot make the fine-grained
sense distinctions specified in the dictionary.
2 Related Work
While it is possible to build an automatic sense tag-
ger using only the dictionary definitions, the most
accurate systems tend to take advantage of super-
vised learning. The system with the highest overall
performance in SENSEVAL-1 used Yarowskys hier-
archical decision lists (Yarowsky, 2000); while there
is a large set of potential features, only a small num-
ber is actually used to determine the sense of any
given instance of a word. Chodorow, Leacock and
Miller (Chodorow et al., 2000) also achieved high
accuracy using naive bayesian models for WSD,
combining sets of linguistically impoverished fea-
tures that were classified as either topical or local.
Topical features consisted of a bag of open-class
words in a wide window covering the entire con-
text provided; local features were words and parts of
speech within a small window or at particular offsets

\x0cfrom the target word. The system was configured to
use only local, only topical, or both local and topical
features for each word, depending on which configu-
ration produced the best result on a held-out portion
of the training data.
Previous experiments (Ng and Lee, 1996) have
explored the relative contribution of different knowl-
edge sources to WSD and have concluded that collo-
cational information is more important than syntac-
tic information. Additionally, Pedersen (Pedersen,
2001; Pedersen, 2000) has pursued the approach
of using simple word bigrams and other linguisti-
cally impoverished feature sets for sense tagging, to
establish upper bounds on the accuracy of feature
sets that do not impose substantial pre-processing
requirements. In contrast, we wish to demonstrate
that such pre-processing significantly improves ac-
curacy for sense-tagging English verbs, because we
believe that they allow us to extract a set of features
that more closely parallels the information humans
use for sense disambiguation.
3 System Description
We developed an automatic WSD system that uses
a maximum entropy framework to combine linguis-
tic contextual features from corpus instances of each
verb to be tagged. Under the maximum entropy
framework (Berger et al., 1996), evidence from dif-
ferent features can be combined with no assump-
tions of feature independence. The automatic tag-
ger estimates the conditional probability that a word
has sense x given that it occurs in context y, where
y is a conjunction of features. The estimated proba-
bility is derived from feature weights which are de-
termined automatically from training data so as to
produce a probability distribution that has maximum
entropy, under the constraint that it is consistent with
observed evidence.
In order to extract the linguistic features neces-
sary for the model, all sentences were first automat-
ically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum en-
tropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using
the Collins parser (Collins, 1997). In addition, an
automatic named entity tagger (Bikel et al., 1997)
was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a
small set of semantic classes. Following work by
Chodorow, Leacock and Miller, we divided the pos-
sible model features into topical and local contex-
tual features. Topical features looked for the pres-
ence of keywords occurring anywhere in the sen-
tence and any surrounding sentences provided as
context (usually one or two sentences). The set
of 200-300 keywords is specific to each lemma to
be disambiguated, and is determined automatically
from training data so as to minimize the entropy of
the probability of the senses conditioned on the key-
word.
The local features for a verb w in a particular sen-
tence tend to look only within the smallest clause
containing w. They include collocational features
requiring no linguistic preprocessing beyond part-
of-speech tagging (1), syntactic features that capture
relations between the verb and its complements (2-
4), and semantic features that incorporate informa-
tion about noun classes for objects (5-6):
1. the word w, the part of speech of w, and words
at positions -2, -1, +1, +2, relative to w
2. whether or not the sentence is passive
3. whether there is a subject, direct object, indi-
rect object, or clausal complement (a comple-
ment whose node label is S in the parse tree)
4. the words (if any) in the positions of subject,
direct object, indirect object, particle, preposi-
tional complement (and its object)
5. a Named Entity tag (PERSON, ORGANIZA-
TION, LOCATION) for proper nouns appear-
ing in (4)
6. WordNet synsets and hypernyms for the nouns
appearing in (4)1
This set of local features relies on access to syntac-
tic structure as well as semantic class information,
and represents our move towards using richer syn-
tactic and semantic knowledge sources to model hu-
man performance.
1
Nouns were not disambiguated in any way, and all possible
synsets and hypernyms for the noun were included. No separate
disambiguation of noun complements was done because, given
enough data, the maximum entropy model should assign high
weights to the correct semantic classes of the correct noun sense
if they represent defining selectional restrictions.
\x0c4 Evaluation
In this section we describe the system performance
on the verbs from SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2.
The system was built after SENSEVAL-1 but before
SENSEVAL-2.2
SENSEVAL-1 SENSEVAL-1 used a DARPA-style
evaluation format where the participants were pro-
vided with hand-annotated training data and test
data. The lexical inventory used was the Hector lex-
icon, developed jointly by DEC and Oxford Univer-
sity Press (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000). By
allowing for discussion and revision of confusing
lexical entries during tagging, before the final test
data was tagged, inter-annotator agreement of over
90% was eventually achieved. However, the Hector
lexicon was very small and under proprietary con-
straints, making it an unsuitable candidate for ap-
plications requiring a large-scale, publicly-available
dictionary.
SENSEVAL-2 The subsequent SENSEVAL-2 exer-
cise used a pre-release version of WordNet1.7 which
is much larger than Hector and is more widely used
in NLP applications. The average training set size
for verbs was only about half of that provided in
SENSEVAL-1, while the average polysemy of each
verb was higher3. Smaller training sets and the
use of a large-scale, publicly available dictionary ar-
guably make SENSEVAL-2 a more indicative evalu-
ation of WSD systems in the current NLP environ-
ment than SENSEVAL-1. The role of sense groups
was also explored as a way to address the pop-
ular criticism that WordNet senses are too vague
and fine-grained. During the data preparation for
SENSEVAL-2, previous WordNet groupings of the
verbs were carefully re-examined, and specific se-
mantic criteria were manually associated with each
group. This occasionally resulted in minor revisions
of the original groupings (Fellbaum et al., 2001).
This manual method of creating a more coarse-
grained sense inventory from WordNet contrasts
with automatic methods that rely on existing se-

cause it was developed by people who were involved in coordi-
nating the English verbs lexical sample task.

mantic links in WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan,
2001), which can produce divergent dictionaries.
Our system performs competitively with the
best performing systems in SENSEVAL-1 and
SENSEVAL-2. Measuring accuracy as the recall
score (which is equal to precision in our case be-
cause the system assigns a tag to every instance), we
compare the systems coarse-grained scores using
the revised groupings versus random groupings, and
demonstrate the coherence and utility of the group-
ings in reconciling apparent tagging disagreements.
4.1 SENSEVAL-1 Results
The maximum entropy WSD systems perfor-
mance on the verbs from the evaluation data for
SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000) ri-
valed that of the best-performing systems. Table 1
shows the performance of variants of the system us-
ing different subsets of possible features. In addition
to experimenting with different combinations of lo-
cal/topical features, we attempted to undo passiviza-
tion transformations to recover underlying subjects
and objects. This was expected to increase the accu-
racy with which verb arguments could be identified,
helping in cases where selectional restrictions on ar-
guments played an important role in differentiating
between senses.
The best overall variant of the system for verbs
did not use WordNet class features, but included
topical keywords and passivization transformation,
giving an average verb accuracy of 72.3%. This
falls between Chodorow, Leacock, and Millers ac-
curacy of 71.0%, and Yarowskys 73.4% (74.3%
post-workshop). If only the best combination of fea-
ture sets for each verb is used, then the maximum en-
tropy models achieve 73.7% accuracy. Even though
our system used only the training data provided and
none of the information from the dictionary itself,
it was still competitive with the top performing sys-
tems which also made use of the dictionary to iden-
tify multi-word constructions. As we show later,
using this additional piece of information improves
performance substantially.
In addition to the SENSEVAL-1 verbs, we ran the
system on the SENSEVAL-1 data for shake, which
contains both nouns and verbs. The system sim-
ply excluded verb complement features whenever
the part-of-speech tagger indicated that the word

mix of nouns and verbs, the system performed
well compared with the best system for shake from
SENSEVAL-1, which had an accuracy of 76.5% on
the same task.
4.2 SENSEVAL-2 Results
We also tested the WSD system on the verbs from
the English lexical sample task for SENSEVAL-2.
In contrast to SENSEVAL-1, senses involving multi-
word constructions could be directly identified from
the sense tags themselves (through the WordNet
sense keys that were used as sense tags), and the
head word and satellites of multi-word construc-
tions were explicitly marked in the training and test
data. This additional annotation made it much eas-
ier for our system to incorporate information about
the satellites, without having to look at the dictio-
nary (whose format may vary from one task to an-
other). The best-performing systems on the English
verb lexical sample task (including our own) filtered
out possible senses based on the marked satellites,
and this improved performance.
Table 2 shows the performance of the system us-
ing different subsets of features. While we found lit-
tle improvement from transforming passivized sen-
tences into a more canonical form to recover under-
lying arguments, there is a clear improvement in per-
formance as richer linguistic information is incorpo-
rated in the model. Adding topical keywords also
helped.
Incorporating topical keywords as well as col-
locational, syntactic, and semantic local features,
our system achieved 59.6% and 69.0% accuracy
using fine-grained and coarse-grained scoring, re-
spectively. This is in comparison to the next best-
performing system, which had fine- and coarse-
grained scores of 57.6% and 67.2% (Palmer et al.,
2001). Here we see the benefit from including a filter
that only considered phrasal senses whenever there
were satellites of multi-word constructions marked
in the test data; had we not included this filter, our
fine- and coarse-grained scores would have been
only 56.9% and 66.1%.

\x0cmum entropy system, and human inter-tagger agree-
ment on fine-grained and coarse-grained senses.
Overall, coarse-grained evaluation using the groups
improved the systems score by about 10%. This
is consistent with the improvement we found in
inter-tagger agreement for groups over fine-grained
senses (82% instead of 71%). As a base-line, to en-
sure that the improvement did not come simply from
the lower number of tag choices for each verb, we
created random groups. Each verb had the same
number of groups, but with the senses distributed
randomly. We found that these random groups pro-
vided almost no benefit to the inter-annotator agree-
ment figures (74% instead of 71%), confirming the
greater coherence of the manual groupings.
4.3 Analysis of errors
We found that the grouped senses for call substan-
tially improved performance over evaluating with
respect to fine-grained senses; the system achieved
63.6% accuracy with coarse-grained scoring using
the groups, as compared to 47.0% accuracy with
fine-grained scoring. When evaluated against the
fine-grained senses, the system got 35 instances
wrong, but 11 of the incorrect instances were
tagged with senses that were actually in the same
group as the correct sense. This group of senses dif-
fers from others in the ability to take a small clause
as a complement, which is modeled as a feature in
our system. Here we see that the system benefits
from using syntactic features that are linguistically
richer than the features that have been used in the
past.
29% of errors made by the tagger on develop were
due to confusing Sense 1 and Sense 2, which are in
the same group. The two senses describe transitive
verbs that create new entities, characterized as either
products, or mental or artistic creations: CREATE
(Sense 1) or a new theory of evolution: CREATE
BY MENTAL ACT (Sense 2). Instances of Sense 1
that were tagged as Sense 2 by the system included:
Researchers said they have developed a genetic en-
gineering technique for creating hybrid plants for
a number of key crops; William Gates and Paul
Allen developed an early language-housekeeper sys-
tem for PCs. Conversely, the following instances of
Sense 2 were tagged as Sense 1 by the tagger: A Pur-
due University team hopes to develop ways to mag-
netically induce cardiac muscle contractions; Kobe
Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology used it
until it developed its own system. Based on the direct
object of develop, the automatic tagger was hard-
pressed to differentiate between developing a tech-
nique/system (Sense 1) and developing a way/system
(Sense 2).
Analysis of inter-annotator disagreement between
two human annotators doing double-blind tagging
revealed similar confusion between these two senses
of develop; 25% of the human annotator disagree-
ments on develop involved determining which of
these two senses should be applied to phrases like
develop a better way to introduce crystallography
techniques. These instances that were difficult for
the automatic WSD system, were also difficult for
human annotators to differentiate consistently.
These different senses are clearly related, but the
relation is not reflected in their hypernyms, which
emphasize the differences in what is being high-
lighted by each sense, rather than the similarities.
Methods of evaluation that automatically back off
from synset to hypernyms (Lin, 1997) would fail
to credit the system for mistagging an instance
with a closely related sense. Manually created sense
groups, on the other hand, can capture broader, more
underspecified senses which are not explicitly listed
and which do not participate in any of the WordNet
semantic relations.
5 Conclusion
We have demonstrated that our approach to disam-
biguating verb senses using maximum entropy mod-
els to combine as many linguistic knowledge sources
as possible, yields state-of-the-art performance for
English. This may be a language-dependent feature,
as other experiments indicate that additional linguis-
tic pre-processing does not necessarily improve tag-
ging accuracy for languages like Chinese (Dang et
al., 2002).
In examining the instances that proved trouble-
some to both the human taggers and the automatic
system, we found errors that were tied to subtle
sense distinctions which were reconciled by back-
ing off to the more coarse-grained sense groups.
Achieving higher inter-annotator agreement is nec-
essary in order to provide consistent training data
\x0cfor supervised WSD systems. Lexicographers have
long recognized that many natural occurrences of
polysemous words are embedded in underspecified
contexts and could correspond to more than one spe-
cific sense. Annotators need the option of selecting,
as an alternative to an explicit sense, either a group
of specific senses or a single, broader sense, where
specific meaning nuances are subsumed. Sense
grouping, already present in a limited way in Word-
Nets verb component, can be guided and enhanced
by the analysis of inter-annotator disagreements and
the development of explicit sense distinction criteria
that such an analysis provides.
