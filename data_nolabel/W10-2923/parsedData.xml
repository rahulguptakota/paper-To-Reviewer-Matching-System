Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999575777777778">
We propose a method for annotating post-
to-post discourse structure in online user
forum data, in the hopes of improving
troubleshooting-oriented information ac-
cess. We introduce the tasks of: (1) post
classification, based on a novel dialogue
act tag set; and (2) link classification. We
also introduce three feature sets (structural
features, post context features and seman-
tic features) and experiment with three dis-
criminative learners (maximum entropy,
SVM-HMM and CRF). We achieve above-
baseline results for both dialogue act and
link classification, with interesting diver-
gences in which feature sets perform well
over the two sub-tasks, and go on to per-
form preliminary investigation of the inter-
action between post tagging and linking.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998010049180328">
With the advent of Web 2.0, there has been an ex-
plosion of web authorship from individuals of all
walks of life. Notably, social networks, blogs and
web user forums have entered the mainstream of
modern-day society, creating both new opportuni-
ties and challenges for organisations seeking to en-
gage with clients or users of any description. One
area of particular interest is web-based user sup-
port, e.g. to aid a user in purchasing a gift for a
friend, or advising a customer on how to config-
ure a newly-acquired wireless router. While such
interactions traditionally took place on an indi-
vidual basis, leading to considerable redundancy
for frequently-arising requests or problems, user
forums support near-real-time user interaction in
the form of a targeted thread made up of individ-
ual user posts. Additionally, they have the poten-
tial for perpetual logging to allow other users to
benefit from them. This in turn facilitates sup-
port sharingi.e. the ability for users to look
over the logs of past support interactions to deter-
mine whether there is a documented, immediately-
applicable solution to their current problemon a
scale previously unimaginable. This research is
targeted at this task of enhanced support sharing,
in the form of text mining over troubleshooting-
oriented web user forum data (Baldwin et al., to
appear).
One facet of our proposed strategy for enhanc-
ing information access to troubleshooting-oriented
web user forum data is to preprocess threads to
uncover the content structure of the thread, in
the form of its post-to-post discourse structure.
Specifically, we identify which earlier post(s) a
given post responds to (linking) and in what man-
ner (tagging), in an amalgam of dialogue act tag-
ging (Stolcke et al., 2000) and coherence-based
discourse analysis (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and
Gibson, 2005). The reason we do this is gauge
the relative role/import of individual posts, to in-
dex and weight component terms accordingly, ul-
timately in an attempt to enhance information ac-
cess. Evidence to suggest that this structure can
enhance information retrieval effectiveness comes
from Xi et al. (2004) and Seo et al. (2009) (see
Section 2).
To illustrate the task, consider the thread from
the CNET forum shown in Figure 1, made up of
5 posts (Post 1, ..., Post 5) with 4 distinct partici-
pants (A, B, C, D). In the first post, A initiates the
thread by requesting assistance in creating a web
form. In response, B proposes a Javascript-based
solution (i.e. responds to the first post with a pro-
posed solution), and C proposes an independent
solution based on .NET (i.e. also responds to the
first post with a proposed solution). Next, A re-
sponds to Cs post asking for details of how to in-
clude this in a web page (i.e. responds to the third
post asking for clarification), and in the final post,
D proposes a different solution again (i.e. responds
to the first post with a different solution again).

In this, we therefore end up with a tree-based de-
pendency link structure, with each post (other than
the initial post) relating back to a unique preced-
ing post via a range of link types, as indicated in
Figure 2. Note, however, that more generally, it
is possible for a post to link to multiple preced-
ing posts (e.g. refuting one proposed solution, and
proposing a different solution to the problem in the
initial post).
Our primary contributions in this paper are: (1)
a novel post label set for post structure in web
forum data, and associated dataset; and (2) a se-
ries of results for post dependency linking and la-
belling, which achieve strong results for the re-
spective tasks.

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996950824561404">
Related work exists in the broad fields of dialogue
processing, discourse analysis and information re-
trieval, and can be broken down into the following
tasks: (1) dialogue act tagging; (2) discourse dis-
entanglement; (3) community question answer-
ing; and (4) newsgroup/user forum search.
Dialogue act (DA) tagging is a means of cap-
turing the function of a given utterance relative
to an encompassing discourse, and has been pro-
posed variously as a means of enhancing dialogue
summarisation (Murray et al., 2006), and track-
ing commitments and promises in email (Cohen
et al., 2004; Lampert et al., 2008), as well as be-
ing shown to improve speech recognition accu-
racy (Stolcke et al., 2000). A wide range of DA
tag sets have been proposed, usually customised
to a particular medium such as speech dialogue
(Stolcke et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 2004), task-
focused email (Cohen et al., 2004; Wang et al.,
2007; Lampert et al., 2008) or instant messag-
ing (Ivanovic, 2008). The most immediately rel-
evant DA-based work we are aware of is that of
Xi et al. (2004), who proposed a 5-way classifi-
cation for newsgroup data (including QUESTION
and AGREEMENT/AMMENDMENT), but did not
present any results based on the tagset.
A range of supervised models have been applied
to DA classification, including graphical mod-
els (Ji and Bilmes, 2005), kernel methods (Wang
et al., 2007), dependency networks (Carvalho
and Cohen, 2005), transformation-based learning
(Samuel et al., 1998), maxent models (Ang et
al., 2005) and HMMs (Ivanovic, 2008). There is
some contention about the import of context in DA
classification, with the prevailing view being that
context aids classification (Carvalho and Cohen,
2005; Ang et al., 2005; Ji and Bilmes, 2005), but
also evidence to suggest that strictly local mod-
elling is superior (Ries, 1999; Serafin and Di Eu-
genio, 2004).
In this work, we draw on existing work (esp.
Xi et al. (2004)) in proposing a novel DA tag
set customised to the analysis of troubleshooting-
oriented web user forums (Section 3), and com-
pare a range of text classification and structured
classification methods for post-level DA classifi-
cation.
Discourse disentanglement is the process of
automatically identifying coherent sub-discourses
in a single thread (in the context of user fo-
rums/mailing lists), chat session (in the context of
IRC chat data: Elsner and Charniak (2008)), sys-
tem interaction (in the context of HCI: Lemon et
al. (2002)) or document (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).
The exact definition of what constitutes a sub-
discourse varies across domains, but for our pur-
poses, entails an attempt to resolve the informa-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999177080645161">
\x0ction need of the initiator by a particular approach;
if there are competing approaches proposed in a
single thread, multiple sub-discourses will neces-
sarily arise. The data structure used to represent
the disentangled discourse varies from a simple
connected sub-graph (Elsner and Charniak, 2008),
to a stack/tree (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lemon
et al., 2002; Seo et al., 2009), to a full directed
acyclic graph (DAG: Rose et al. (1995), Wolf and
Gibson (2005), Schuth et al. (2007)). Disentan-
glement has been carried out via analysis of di-
rect citation/user name references (Schuth et al.,
2007; Seo et al., 2009), topic modelling (Lin et al.,
2009), and clustering over content-based features
for pairs of posts, optionally incorporating various
constraints on post recency (Elsner and Charniak,
2008; Wang et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2009).
In this work, we follow Rose et al. (1995) and
Wolf and Gibson (2005) in adopting a DAG repre-
sentation of discourse structure, and draw on the
wide set of features used in discourse entangle-
ment to model coherence.
Community question answering (cQA) is the
task of identifying questionanswer pairs in a
given thread, e.g. for the purposes of thread sum-
marisation (Shrestha and McKeown, 2004) or au-
tomated compilation of resources akin to Yahoo!
Answers. cQA has been applied to both mail-
ing list and user forum threads, conventionally
based on question classification, followed by rank-
ing of candidate answers relative to each question
(Shrestha and McKeown, 2004; Ding et al., 2008;
Cong et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2009). The task is
somewhat peripheral to our work, but relevant in
that it involves the implicit tagging of certain posts
as containing questions/answers, as well as link-
ing the posts together. Once again, we draw on the
features used in cQA in this research.
There has been a spike of recent interest in
newsgroup/user forum search. Xi et al. (2004)
proposed a structured information retrieval (IR)
model for newsgroup search, based on author fea-
tures, thread structure (based on the tree defined by
the reply-to structure), thread topology features
and content-based features, and used a supervised
ranking method to improve over a baseline IR sys-
tem. Elsas and Carbonell (2009) building on
earlier work on blog search (Elsas et al., 2008)
proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks
user forum threads relative to selected posts in the
overall thread, and again demonstrated the superi-
ority of this method over a model which ignores
thread structure. Finally, Seo et al. (2009) auto-
matically derived thread structure from user forum
threads, and demonstrated that the IR effectiveness
over the threaded structure was superior to that
using a monolithic document representation.
The observations and results of Xi et al. (2004)
and Seo et al. (2009) that threading information
(or in our case disentangled DAG structure) en-
hances IR effectiveness is a core motivator for this
research.

3 Post Label Set
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991600161290323">
Our post label set contains 12 categories, intended
to capture the typical interactions that take place in
troubleshooting-oriented threads on technical fo-
rums. There are 2 super-categories (QUESTION,
ANSWER) and 3 singleton classes (RESOLUTION,
REPRODUCTION, and OTHER). QUESTION, in
turn, contains 4 sub-classes (QUESTION, ADD,
CONFIRMATION, CORRECTION), while ANSWER
contains 5 sub-classes (ANSWER, ADD, CONFIR-
MATION, CORRECTION, and OBJECTION), par-
tially mirroring the sub-structure of QUESTION.
We represent the amalgam of a super- and sub-
class as QUESTION-ADD, for example.
All tags other than QUESTION-QUESTION and
OTHER are relational, i.e. relate a given post to a
unique earlier post. A given post can potentially
be labelled with multiple tags (e.g. confirm details
of a proposed solution, in addition to providing ex-
tra details of the problem), although, based on the
strictly chronological ordering of posts in threads,
a post can only link to posts earlier in the thread
(and can also not cross thread boundaries). Addi-
tionally, the link structure is assumed to be tran-
sitive, in that if post A links to post B and post B
to post C, post A is implicitly linked to post C. As
such, an explicit link from post A to post C should
exist only in the case that the link between them is
not inferrable transitively.
Detailed definitions of each post tag are given
below. Note that initiator refers to the user who
started the thread with the first post.

4 Feature Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999795">
In this section, we describe our post feature repre-
sentation, in the form of four feature types.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997324">
4.1 Lexical features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999158444444444">
As our first feature type, we use simple lexical fea-
tures, in the form of unigram and bigram tokens
contained within a given post (without stopping).
We also POS tagged and lemmatised the posts,
postfixing the lemmatised token with its POS tag
(using Lingua::EN::Tagger and morpha (Min-
nen et al., 2001)). Finally, we bin together the
counts for each token, and represent it via its raw
frequency.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992358">
4.2 Structural features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802714285714">
The identity of the post author, and position of the
post within the thread, can be indicators of the
post/link structure of a given post. We represent
the post author as a simple binary feature indicat-
ing whether s/he is the thread initiator, and the post
position via its relative position in the thread (as a
ratio, relative to the total number of posts).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984416">
4.3 Post context features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994860848484848">
As mentioned in Section 2, post context has gen-
erally (but not always) been shown to enhance the
classification accuracy of DA tagging tasks, in the
form of Markov features providing predicted post
labels for previous posts, or more simply, post-to-
post similarity. We experiment with a range of
post context features, all of which are compatible
with features both from the same label set as that
being classified (e.g. link features for link classifi-
cation), as well as features from a second label set
(e.g. DA label features for link classification).
Previous Post: There is a strong prior for posts
to link to their immediately preceding post (as ob-
served for 79.9% of the data in our dataset), and
also strong sequentiality in our post label set (e.g.
a post following a Q-Q is most likely to be an A-
A). As such, we represent the predicted post label
of the immediately preceding post, as a first-order
Markov feature, as well as a binary feature to in-
dicate whether the author of the previous post also
authored the current post.
Previous Post from Same Author: A given
user tends to author posts of the same basic type
(e.g. QUESTION or ANSWER) in a given thread,
and pairings such as A-A and A-CONF from a
given author are very rare. To capture this obser-
vation, we look to see if the author of the current
post has posted earlier in the thread, and if so, in-
clude the label and relative location (in posts) of
their most recent previous post.
Full History: As a final option, we include the
predictions for all posts P1, ..., Pi1 preceding the
current post Pi.

<bodyText confidence="0.941230083333333">
\x0cTitle Similarity: For forums such as CNET
which include titles for individual posts (as rep-
resented in Figure 1), a post having the same or
similar title as a previous post is often a strong
indicator that it responds to that post. This both
provides a strong indicator of which post a given
post responds (links) to, and can aid in DA tag-
ging. We use simple cosine similarity to find the
post with the most-similar title, and represent its
relative location to the current post.
Post Similarity: Posts of the same general type
tend to have similar content and be linked. For
example, A-A and A-ADD posts tend to share
content. We capture this by identifying the post
with most-similar content based on cosine similar-
ity, and represent its relative location to the current
post.
Post Characteristics: We separately represent
the number of question marks, exclamation marks
and URLs in the current post. In general, ques-
tion marks occur in QUESTION and CONFIRMA-
TION posts, exclamation marks occur in RES and
OBJECTION posts, and URLs occur in A-A and
A-ADD posts.

5 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995989823529412">
As our dataset, we collected 320 threads contain-
ing a total of 1,332 posts from the Operating Sys-
tem, Software, Hardware, and Web Development
sub-forums of CNET.1
The annotation of post labels and links was car-
ried by two annotators in a custom-built web inter-
face which supported multiple labels and links for
a given post. For posts with multilabels, we used
a modified version of Cohens Kappa, which re-
turned values of 0.59 and 0.78 for the post label
and link annotations, respectively. Any disagree-
ments in labelling were resolved through adjudi-
cation.
Of the 1332 posts, 65 posts have multiple labels
(which possibly link to a common post) and 22
posts link to two different links. The majority post
label in the dataset is A-A (40.30%).

We built machine learners using a conven-
tional Maximum Entropy (ME) learner,2 as well as
two structural learners, namely: (1) SVM-HMMs
(Joachims et al., 2009), as implemented in SVM-
struct3, with a linear kernel; and (2) conditional
random fields (CRFs) using CRF++.4 SVM-
HMMs and CRFs have been successfully applied
to a range of sequential tagging tasks such as
syllabification (Bartlett et al., 2009), chunk pars-
ing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and word segmen-
tation (Zhao et al., 2006). Both are discrimina-
tive models which capture structural dependen-
cies, which is highly desirable in terms of mod-
elling sequential preferences between post labels
(e.g. A-CONF typically following a A-A). SVM-
HMM has the additional advantage of scaling to
large numbers of features (namely the lexical fea-
tures). As such, we only experiment with lexical
features for SVM-HMM and ME.
All of our evaluation is based on stratified 10-
fold cross-validation, stratifying at the thread level
to ensure that if a given post is contained in the
test data for a given iteration, all other posts in
that same thread are also in the test data (or more
pertinently, not in the training data). We evalu-
ate using micro-averaged precision, recall and F-
score ( = 1). We test the statistical significance
of all above-baseline results using randomised es-
timation (p &amp;lt; 0.05; Yeh (2000)), and present all
such results in bold in our results tables.
In our experiments, we first look at the post
classification task in isolation (i.e. we predict
which labels to associate with each post, under-
specifying which posts those labels relate to). We
then move on to look at the link classification task,
again in isolation (i.e. we predict which previous
posts each post links to, underspecifying the na-
ture of the link). Finally, we perform preliminary
investigation of the joint task of DA and link clas-
sification, by incorporating DA class features into
the link classification task.

First, we experiment with lexical and structural
features (recalling that we are unable to scale the
CRF model to full lexical features). Lexical fea-
tures produce below-baseline performance, while
simple structural features immediately lead to an
improvement over the baseline for CRF and ME.
The reason for the poor performance with lex-
ical features is that our dataset contains only
around 1300 posts, each of which is less than 100
words in length on average. The models are sim-
ply unable to generalise over this small amount of
data, and in the case of SVM-HMM, the presence
of lexical features, if anything, appears to obscure
the structured nature of the labelling task (i.e. the
classifier is unable to learn the simple heuristic
used by the modified majority class baseline).
The success of the structural features, on the
other hand, points to the presence of predictable
sequences of post labels in the data. That SVM-
HMM is unable to achieve baseline performance
with structural features is slightly troubling.

Next, we test the two post context features: Previ-

(A). Given the success of structural features, we
retain these in our experiments. Note that the la-
bels used in the post context are those which are
interactively learned by that model for the previ-
ous posts.

do not present any combinations of Previous Post

Comparing back to the original results using
only the structural results, we can observe that Pre-
vious Post from Same Author and Full History (A
and F, resp., in the table) lead to a slight incre-
ment in F-score for both CRF and SVM-HMM,
but degrade the performance of ME. Previous Post
leads to either a marginal improvement, or a drop
in results, most noticeably for ME. It is slightly
surprising that the CRF should benefit from con-
text features at all, given that it is optimising over
the full tag sequence, but the impact is relatively
localised, and when all sets of context features
are used, the combined weight of noisy features
appears to swamp the learner, leading to a sharp
degradation in F-score.

Similarly to the post context features, the se-
mantic features produced slight increments over
the structural features in isolation, especially for
CRF and ME. For the first time, SVM-HMM
achieved above-baseline results, when incorporat-

individual semantic features, title and post simi-
larity appear to be the best performers. Slightly
disappointingly, the combination of semantic fea-
tures generally led to a degradation in F-score, al-
most certainly due to data sparseness. The best

To further explore the interaction between post
context and semantic features, we built CRF clas-

and semantic features, and present the results in
Table 4.5 We achieved moderate gains in F-score,
with all post context features, in combination with
structural features, post similarity and post char-
acteristics achieving an F-score of 0.753, slightly
higher than the best result achieved for just struc-
tural and post context features.
It is important to refer back to the results for
lexical features (comparable to what would have
been achieved with a standard text categorisation
approach to the task), and observe that we have
achieved far higher F-scores using features cus-
tomised to user forum data. It is also important
to reflect that post context (in terms of the features
and the structured classification results of CRF)
appears to markedly improve our results, contrast-
ing with the results of Ries (1999) and Serafin and
Di Eugenio (2004).

Our second experiment is based on link classifi-
cation in isolation. Here, we predict unlabelled
edges, e.g. in Figure 2, the gold-standard classifi-
cation for Post 1 would be NULL, Post 2 would be
Post 1, Post 3 would be Post 1, etc.
Note that the initial post cannot link to any other
post, and also that the second post always links
to the first post. As this is a hard constraint on
the data, and these posts simply act to inflate the
overall numbers, we exclude all first and second
posts from our evaluation of link classification.
We experimented with a range of baselines as
presented in Table 5, but found that the best per-
former by far was the simple heuristic of linking
each post (except for the initial post) to its imme-
diately preceding post. This leads to an F-score of
0.631, comparable to that for the post classifica-
tion task.

ror those for post classification: small improve-
ments are observed for title similarity with CRF,
but otherwise, the results degrade across the board,
and the combination of different feature sets com-
pounds this effect.
The best overall result achieved for link classifi-
cation is thus the 0.743 for CRF with the structural
and post context features.

tions of features as for post classification, but were

sification task, or alternatively by looking to joint
modelling methods. As a preliminary step in this
direction, and means of exploring the interaction
between the two tasks, we repeat the experiment
based on post context features from above (see
Section 7.2), but rather than using link-based post
context, we use DA-based post context.
As can be seen in Table 9, the results for SVM-
HMM and ME drop appreciably as compared to
the results using link-based post context in Table 9,
while the results for CRF jump to the highest level
achieved for the task for all three learners. The
effect can be ascribed to the ability of CRF to
natively model the (bidirectional) link classifica-
tion history in the process of performing structured
learning, and the newly-introduced post features
complementing the link classification task.

8 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694522727273">
Ultimately, we require both DA and link classifica-
tion of each post, which is possible in (at least) the
following three ways: (1) by combining the out-
puts of the component classifiers described above;
(2) by rolling the two tasks into a single classifi-
cation task; or (3) by looking to joint modelling
methods. Our results in Section 7.4 are suggestive
of the empirical potential of performing the two
tasks jointly, which we hope to explore in future
work.
One puzzling effect observed in our experi-
ments was the generally poor results for SVM. Er-
ror analysis indicates that the classifier was heav-
ily biased towards the high-frequency classes, e.g.
classifying all posts as either Q-Q or A-A for DA
classification. The classifications for the other two
learners were much more evenly spread across the
different classes.
CRF was limited in that it was unable to cap-
ture lexical features, but ultimately, lexical fea-
tures were found to be considerably less effec-
tive than structural and post context features for
both tasks, and the ability of the CRF to opti-
mise the post labelling over the full sequence of
posts in a thread more than compensated for this
shortcoming. Having said this, there is more work
to be done exploring synergies between the dif-
ferent feature sets, especially for DA classifica-
tion where all feature sets were found to produce
above-baseline results.
Another possible direction for future research is
to explore the impact of inter-post time on link
structure, based on the observation that follow-
up posts from the initiator tend to be tempo-
rally adjacent to posts they respond to with rela-
tively short time intervals, while posts from non-
initiators which are well spaced out tend not to re-
spond to one another. Combining this with pro-
filing of the cross-thread behaviour of individual
forum participants (Weimer et al., 2007; Lui and
Baldwin, 2009), and formal modelling of forum
behaviour is also a promising line of research,
taking the lead from the work of Gotz et al. (2009),
inter alia.

9 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999301533333333">
In this work, we have proposed a method for
analysing post-to-post discourse structure in on-
line user forum data, in the form of post link-
ing and dialogue act tagging. We introduced
three feature sets: structural features, post con-
text features and semantic features. We exper-
imented with three learners (maximum entropy,
SVM-HMM and CRF), and established that CRF
is the superior approach to the task, achieving
above-baseline results for both post and link clas-
sification. We also demonstrated the complemen-
tarity of the proposed feature sets, especially for
the post classification task, and carried out a pre-
liminary exploration of the interaction between the
linking and dialogue act tagging tasks.

<abstract confidence="0.996755263157895">We propose a method for annotating postto-post discourse structure in online user forum data, in the hopes of improving troubleshooting-oriented information access. We introduce the tasks of: (1) post classification, based on a novel dialogue act tag set; and (2) link classification. We also introduce three feature sets (structural features, post context features and semantic features) and experiment with three discriminative learners (maximum entropy, SVM-HMM and CRF). We achieve abovebaseline results for both dialogue act and link classification, with interesting divergences in which feature sets perform well over the two sub-tasks, and go on to perform preliminary investigation of the interaction between post tagging and linking.</abstract>

Both are discriminative models which capture structural dependencies, which is highly desirable in terms of modelling sequential preferences between post labels (e.g. A-CONF typically following a A-A). SVMHMM has the additional advantage of scaling to large numbers of features (namely the lexical features). As such, we only experiment with lexical features for SVM-HMM and ME. All of our evaluation is based on stratified 10- fold cross-validation, stratifying at the thread level to ensure that if a given post is </context>

One facet of our proposed strategy for enhancing information access to troubleshooting-oriented web user forum data is to preprocess threads to uncover the content structure of the thread, in the form of its post-to-post discourse structure. Specifically, we identify which earlier post(s) a given post responds to (linking) and in what manner (tagging), in an amalgam of dialogue act tagging (Stolcke et al., 2000) and coherence-based discourse analysis (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005). The reason we do this is gauge the relative role/import of individual posts, to index and weight component terms accordingly, ultimately in an attempt to enhance information access. Evidence to suggest that this structure can enhance information retrieval effectiveness comes from Xi et al. (2004) and Seo et al. (2009) (see Section 2). To illustrate the task, consider the thread from the CNET forum shown in Figure 1, made up of 5 posts (Post 1, ..., Post 5) with 4 distinct participants (A, B, C, D). In the first post, A initiates the thread by requesting assistance in </context>

Specifically, we identify which earlier post(s) a given post responds to (linking) and in what manner (tagging), in an amalgam of dialogue act tagging (Stolcke et al., 2000) and coherence-based discourse analysis (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005). The reason we do this is gauge the relative role/import of individual posts, to index and weight component terms accordingly, ultimately in an attempt to enhance information access. Evidence to suggest that this structure can enhance information retrieval effectiveness comes from Xi et al. (2004) and Seo et al. (2009) (see Section 2). To illustrate the task, consider the thread from the CNET forum shown in Figure 1, made up of 5 posts (Post 1, ..., Post 5) with 4 distinct participants (A, B, C, D). In the first post, A initiates the thread by requesting assistance in creating a web form. In response, B proposes a Javascript-based solution (i.e. responds to the first post with a proposed solution), and C proposes an independent solution based on .NET (i.e. also responds to the first post with a proposed solution). Next, A responds to Cs post asking for details of how to include this in a web page (i.e. resp</context>

Once again, we draw on the features used in cQA in this research. There has been a spike of recent interest in newsgroup/user forum search. Xi et al. (2004) proposed a structured information retrieval (IR) model for newsgroup search, based on author features, thread structure (based on the tree defined by the reply-to structure), thread topology features and content-based features, and used a supervised ranking method to improve over a baseline IR system. Elsas and Carbonell (2009) building on earlier work on blog search (Elsas et al., 2008) proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks user forum threads relative to selected posts in the overall thread, and again demonstrated the superiority of this method over a model which ignores thread structure. Finally, Seo et al. (2009) automatically derived thread structure from user forum threads, and demonstrated that the IR effectiveness over the threaded structure was superior to that using a monolithic document representation.

We also POS tagged and lemmatised the posts, postfixing the lemmatised token with its POS tag (using Lingua::EN::Tagger and morpha (Minnen et al., 2001)). Finally, we bin together the counts for each token, and represent it via its raw frequency. 4.2 Structural features The identity of the post author, and position of the post within the thread, can be indicators of the post/link structure of a given post. We represent the post author as a simple binary feature indicating whether s/he is the thread initiator, and the post position via its relative position in the thread (as a ratio, relative to the total number of posts). 4.3 Post context features As mentioned in Section 2, post context has generally (but not always) been shown to enhance the</context>

It is important to refer back to the results for lexical features (comparable to what would have been achieved with a standard text categorisation approach to the task), and observe that we have achieved far higher F-scores using features customised to user forum data. It is also important to reflect that post context (in terms of the features and the structured classification results of CRF) appears to markedly improve our results, contrasting with the results of Ries (1999) and Serafin and Di Eugenio (2004). 5 We omit the results for Full History post context for reasons of space, but there is relatively little deviation from the numbers presented.

The most immediately relevant DA-based work we are aware of is that of Xi et al. (2004), who proposed a 5-way classification for newsgroup data (including QUESTION and AGREEMENT/AMMENDMENT), but did not present any results based on the tagset. A range of supervised models have been applied to DA classification, including graphical models (Ji and Bilmes, 2005), kernel methods (Wang et al., 2007), dependency networks (Carvalho and Cohen, 2005), transformation-based learning (Samuel et al., 1998), maxent models (Ang et al., 2005) and HMMs (Ivanovic, 2008). There is some contention about the import of context in DA classification, with the prevailing view being that context aids classification (Carvalho and Cohen, 2005; Ang et al., 2005; Ji and Bilmes, 2005), but also evidence to suggest that strictly local modelling is superior (Ries, 1999; Serafin and Di Eugenio, 2004).

Elsas and Carbonell (2009) building on earlier work on blog search (Elsas et al., 2008) proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks user forum threads relative to selected posts in the overall thread, and again demonstrated the superiority of this method over a model which ignores thread structure. Finally, Seo et al. (2009) automatically derived thread structure from user forum threads, and demonstrated that the IR effectiveness over the threaded structure was superior to that using a monolithic document representation. The observations and results of Xi et al. (2004) and Seo et al.

Both are discriminative models which capture structural dependencies, which is highly desirable in terms of modelling sequential preferences between post labels (e.g. A-CONF typically following a A-A). SVMHMM has the additional advantage of scaling to large numbers of features (namely the lexical features). As such, we only experiment with lexical features for SVM-HMM and ME.

Another possible direction for future research is to explore the impact of inter-post time on link structure, based on the observation that followup posts from the initiator tend to be temporally adjacent to posts they respond to with relatively short time intervals, while posts from noninitiators which are well spaced out tend not to respond to one another. Combining this with profiling of the cross-thread behaviour of individual forum participants (Weimer et al., 2007; Lui and Baldwin, 2009), and formal modelling of forum behaviour is also a promising line of research, taking the lead from the work of Gotz et al. (2009), inter alia. 9 Conclusion In this work, we have proposed a method for analysing post-to-post discourse structure in online user forum data, in the form of post linking and dialogue act tagging. We introduced three feature sets: structural features, post context features and semantic features. We experimented with three learners (maximum entropy, SVM-HMM and CRF), and established that CRF is the superior approach to the task, achieving above</context>

(2004)) in proposing a novel DA tag set customised to the analysis of troubleshootingoriented web user forums (Section 3), and compare a range of text classification and structured classification methods for post-level DA classification. Discourse disentanglement is the process of automatically identifying coherent sub-discourses in a single thread (in the context of user forums/mailing lists), chat session (in the context of IRC chat data: Elsner and Charniak (2008)), system interaction (in the context of HCI: Lemon et al. (2002)) or document (Wolf and Gibson, 2005). The exact definition of what constitutes a subdiscourse varies across domains, but for our purposes, entails an attempt to resolve the informa193 \x0ction need of the initiator by a particular approach; if there are competing approaches proposed in a single thread, multiple sub-discourses will necessarily arise. The data structure used to represent the disentangled discourse varies from a simple connected sub-graph (Elsner and Charniak, 2008), to a stack/tree (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lemon et al., 2002; Seo et al., 2009), to a full directed acyclic graph (DAG: Rose et al.

Specifically, we identify which earlier post(s) a given post responds to (linking) and in what manner (tagging), in an amalgam of dialogue act tagging (Stolcke et al., 2000) and coherence-based discourse analysis (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005). The reason we do this is gauge the relative role/import of individual posts, to index and weight component terms accordingly, ultimately in an attempt to enhance information access. Evidence to suggest that this structure can enhance information retrieval effectiveness comes from Xi et al. (2004) and Seo et al. (2009) (see Section 2). To illustrate the task, consider the thread from the CNET forum shown in Figure 1, made up of 5 posts (Post 1, ..., Post 5) with 4 distinct participants (A, B, C, D). In the first post, A initiates the thread by requesting assistance in creating a web form. In response, B proposes a Javascript-based solution (i.e. responds to the first post with a proposed solution), and C proposes an independent solution based on .NET (i.e. also responds to the first post with a proposed solution). Next, A responds to Cs post asking for details of how to include this in</context>

A wide range of DA tag sets have been proposed, usually customised to a particular medium such as speech dialogue (Stolcke et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 2004), taskfocused email (Cohen et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007; Lampert et al., 2008) or instant messaging (Ivanovic, 2008). The most immediately relevant DA-based work we are aware of is that of Xi et al. (2004), who proposed a 5-way classification for newsgroup data (including QUESTION and AGREEMENT/AMMENDMENT), but did not present any results based on the tagset. A range of supervised models have been applied to DA classification, including graphical models (Ji and Bilmes, 2005), kernel methods (Wang et al., 2007), dependency networks (Carvalho and Cohen, 2005), transformation-based learning (Samuel et al., 1998), maxent models (Ang et al., 2005) and HMMs (Ivanovic, 2008). There is some contention about the import of context in DA classification, with the prevailing view being that context aids cla</context>

The task is somewhat peripheral to our work, but relevant in that it involves the implicit tagging of certain posts as containing questions/answers, as well as linking the posts together. Once again, we draw on the features used in cQA in this research. There has been a spike of recent interest in newsgroup/user forum search. Xi et al. (2004) proposed a structured information retrieval (IR) model for newsgroup search, based on author features, thread structure (based on the tree defined by the reply-to structure), thread topology features and content-based features, and used a supervised ranking method to improve over a baseline IR system. Elsas and Carbonell (2009) building on earlier work on blog search (Elsas et al., 2008) proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks user forum threads relative to selected posts in the overall thread, and again demonstrated the superiority of this method over a model which ignores thread st</context>

All of our evaluation is based on stratified 10- fold cross-validation, stratifying at the thread level to ensure that if a given post is contained in the test data for a given iteration, all other posts in that same thread are also in the test data (or more pertinently, not in the training data). We evaluate using micro-averaged precision, recall and Fscore ( = 1). We test the statistical significance of all above-baseline results using randomised estimation (p &amp;lt; 0.05; Yeh (2000)), and present all such results in bold in our results tables. In our experiments, we first look at the post classification task in isolation (i.e. we predict which labels to associate with each post, underspecifying which posts those labels relate to). We then move on to look at the link classification task, again in isolation (i.e. we predict which previous posts each post links to, underspecifying the nature of the link). Finally, we perform preliminary investigation of the joint task of DA and link classification, by incorporating DA class features into the link classification task. 6 DA C</context>

Both are discriminative models which capture structural dependencies, which is highly desirable in terms of modelling sequential preferences between post labels (e.g. A-CONF typically following a A-A). SVMHMM has the additional advantage of scaling to large numbers of features (namely the lexical features). As such, we only experiment with lexical features for SVM-HMM and ME.
