Abstract
Part of Speech tagging for English seems to have
reached the the human levels of error, but full mor-
phological tagging for inflectionally rich languages,
such as Romanian, Czech, or Hungarian, is stillan
open problem, and the results are far from being
satisfactory. This paper presents results obtained
by using a universalizedexponential feature-based
model for fivesuch languages. Itfocuseson the data
sparseness issue,which is especiallysevere for such
languages (the more so that there are no extensive
annotated data for those languages). In conclusion,
we argue strongly that the use of an independent
morphological dictionary is the preferred choice to
more annotated data under such circumstances.
1 Full Morphological Tagging
English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been
widely described in the recent past, starting with
the (Church, 1988) paper, followed by numerous
others using various methods: neural networks (Ju-
lian Benello and Anderson, 1989), HMM tagging
(Merialdo, 1992), decision trees (Schmid, 1994),
transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill,
1995), and maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996),
to selectjust a few. However differentthe methods
were, English dominated in these tests.
Unfortunately, English is a morphologically "im-
poverished" language: there are no complicated
agreement relations, word order variation is mini-
real, and the morphological categories are either ex-
tremely simple (-s for plural of nouns, for example),
or (almost) nonexistent (cases expressed by inflec-
tion, for example) - with not too many exceptions
and irregularities. Therefore the number of tags se-
lected for an English tagset is not that large (40-75
in the typical case). Also, the average ambiguity
is low (2.32 tags per token on the manually tagged
* The work described herein has been started and largely
done within author's home institution, the Institute of For-
mal and AppliedLinguistics,CharlesUniversity,Prague, CZ,

of the Czech Republic and partially also under the grant
405/96/K214 of the Grant Agencyofthe CzechRepublic.
Wall Street Journal part in the Penn Treebank, for
example).
Highly inflective and agglutinative languages are
different. Obviously we can limit the number of tags
to the major part-of-speech classes, plus some (like
the Xerox Language Tools (Chanod, 1997) for such
languages do), and in fact achieve similar perfor-
mance, but that limits the usefulness of the results
thus obtained for further analysis. These languages,
obviously, do not use the rich inflection just for the
amusement (or embarrassment) of their speakers (or
NLP researchers): the inflectional categories carry
important information which ought to be known at
a later time (e.g., during parsing). Thus one wants
not only to tell apart verbs from nouns, but also
nominative from genitive, masculine animate from
inanimate, singular from plural - all of them being
often ambiguous one way or the other.
The average tagset, as found even in a moderate
corpus, contains between 500 and 1,000 distinct tags
- whereas the size of the set of possible and plausible
tags can reach 3,000 to 5,000. Obviously, any of the
statistical methods used for English (even if fully
supervised) clash with (or, fall through) the data
sparseness problem (see below Table 1 for details).
There have been attempts to solve this problem
for some of the highly inflectional European lan-
guages ((Daelemans et al., 1996), (Erjavec et al.,
1999), (Tufts, 1999), and also our own in (Haji~
and Hladk~, 1997), (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1998), see
also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has
been evaluated against a larger number of those lan-
guages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-by-
side comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full
morphological tagging of those languages. Thanks
to the Multext-East project (V6ronis, 1996a), there
are now five annotated corpora available (which are
manually fully morphologically tagged) to perform
such experiments.
2 The Languages Used and The
Training Data
We use the Multext-East-annotated version of the
Orwell's 1984 novel in Czech, Estonian, Hungarian,
94
Romanian and SloveneI. The annotation uses a sin-
gle SGML-based formal scheme, and even common
guidelines for tagset design and annotation, nev-
ertheless the tagsets differsubstantially since the
languages differas well: Romanian is a French-like
romance language, Hungarian is agglutinative,and
the other languages are more or less inflectional-
type languages2. The annotated data containsabout
100k tokens (including punctuation) for each lan-
guage; out of those, the first20k tokens has been
used for testing,the restfor training. We have also
extended the tag identifiersby appending a string
of hyphens ('-')to suitthe exponential tagger which
expects the tags to be of equal length;the mapping
was 1:1 for alltags in alllanguages, sincethe "long"
tags are in fact the Multext-East standard.
From the tagging point ofview, the language char-
acteristicsdisplayed in Table 1 are the most rele-
vant3 .
3 The Methodology
The main tagger used for the comparison experiment
is the probabilistic exponential-model-based, error-
driven learner we described in detail in (Haji~ and
Hladk~, 1998). Modifications had to be made, how-
ever, to make it more universal across languages.
3.1 Structure of the Model
The model described in (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1998)
is a general exponential (specifically, a log-linear)
model (such as the one used for Maximum Entropy-
based models):
pAc(ylx ) = exp(~]in_1AJi(y, x))
z(x) (1)
where fi(y,x) is a binary-valued featureof the
event value being predicted and its context, A~ is
a weight of the feature fi, and Z(x) is the natural
normalization factor. This model isthen essentially
reduced to Naive Bayes by the approximation of the
IThere are more languages involved in the Multext-East
project, but only these fivelanguages have been reallycare-
fullytagged; English isunfortunately tagged using Eric Brill's
tagger trainedin unsupervised mode, leavingmultiple output
at almost every ambiguous token, and Bulgarian is totally
unusable since it has been tagged automatically with only
a baseline tagger. The English resultsreported below thus
come from the Penn Treebank data, from which we have used
roughly 100,000 words to match the trainingdata sizesforthe
remaining languages. For Czech, Hungarian, and Slovene we
use laterversionsof the annotated data (than those found on
the Multext-East CD) which we obtained directlyfrom the
authors of the annotations after the Multext-CD had been
published, since the new data contain rather substantialim-
provements over the originallypublished data.
2For detailedaccount of the lexicalcharacteristicsof these
languages, see (Vdronis, 1996b).
3We have included English here for comparison purposes,
since these characteristicsare independent of the annotation.
Ai parameters, which is done because there are mil-
lions of possible features in the pool and thus the full
entropy maximization is prohibitively expensive, if
we want to select a small number of features instead
of keeping them all.
The tags are predicted separately for each mor-
phological category (such as POS, NUMBER,
CASE, DEGREE OF COMPARISON, etc.). The
model makes an extensive use of so-called"ambigu-
ity classes" (ACs). An ambiguity class is a set of
values (such as genitiveand accusative) of a single
category (such as CASE) which arisesfor some word
forms as a resultof morphological analysis. For un-
ambiguous word forms (unambiguous from the point
ofview ofa certaincategory),the ambiguity classset
contains only a singlevalue; for ambiguous forms,
there are 2 or more values in the AC. For example,
let'ssuppose we use part-of-speech (POS), number
and tense as morphological categories for English;
then the word form "borrowed" is2-way ambiguous
in POS ({V,J} for verb and adjective,respectively),
unambiguous in number (linguisticarguments apart,
number istypicallyregarded "not applicable" to ad-
jectives as well as to almost all forms of verbs in
English), and 3-way ambiguous in tense ({P,N,-)
for past tense, past participle, and "not applicable"
in the adjective form).
The predictions of the models are always condi-
tioned on the ambiguity class of the category (POS,
NUMBER, ...) in question. In other words, there is
a separate model for each category and an ambigu-
ity class from that category. Naturally, there is no
model for unambiguous ACs classes. However, even
though the ambiguity classes bring very valuable in-
formation about the word form being tagged and a
reliable information about the context (since they
are fixed during tagging), using ACs causes also an
unwelcome effect of partitioning the already scarce
data and also effectively ignores statistics of the un-
ambiguous cases.
The context of features uses the neighboring words
(original word forms) and ambiguity classes on sub-
tags, where their relative position in text might be
either fixed (0, -1, +1) or "variable" using a value of
the POS subtag as the "stop here" criterion, up to
4 text positions (words) apart.
3.2 General Subtag Features
The original model uses the ambiguity classes not
only for conditioning on context in features, but also
for the individual models based on category and an
AC.
More general features have been introduced,
which do not depend on the ambiguity class of the
subtag being predicted any more. This allows to
learn also from unambiguous tokens. However, the
training time is increased dramatically by doing so
since all events in the training data have to be taken

into consideration, as opposed to the case of training
the small AC-based model, when only those training
events which contain the particular AC are used.
3.3 Variable Distance Condition
The "stop" criterion for finding the appropriate rel-
ative position was originally based on hard coded
choices suitable for the Czech language only, and of
course it depended on the tagset as well. This depen-
dency has been removed by selecting the appropriate
conditions automatically when building the pool of
possible features at the initialization phase 5 (using
the relative frequency of the POS ambiguity classes,
and a threshold to cut off less frequent categories to
limit the size of the feature pool).
3.4 Weight Variation
Even though the full computation of the appropriate
feature weight is still prohibitive (the more so when
the general features are added), the learner is now
allowed to vary the weights (in several discrete steps)
during feature selection, as a (somewhat crude) at-
tempt to depart from the Naive Bayes simplification
to the approximation of the "correct" Maximum En-
tropy estimation.
3.5 Handling Unknown Words
In order to compare the effects of (not) using an in-
dependent dictionary, we have added an unknown
word handling module to the code.6 It extracts
the prefix and suffix frequency information (and the
combination thereof) from the training data. Then,
for each of the combinations, it selects the most fre-
quent set of tags seen in the training data and stores
it for later use. When tagging, the data is first piped
through a "guesser" which assigns to the unknown
words such a set of possible tags which is stored with
the longest matching prefix/suffix combination.
5Also,the use ofvariable-distance context may be switched
offentirely.
6Originally, the code relied exclusively on the use of such
an independent dictionary. Sincethe coverage of the Czech
dictionary we have used is extensive, we have been simply
ignoring the unknown wordproblem altogether in the past.
4 The Results
4.1 Reporting Error Rate: Words vs.
Tokens
Since "best-only" tagging has been carried out, the
error rate (i.e, 100 - accuracy in %) measure has
been used throughout as the only evaluation crite-
rion. However, since some results reported previ-
ously were apparently obtained using only the "real"
words as the total for accuracy evaluation, whereas
in other experiments every token counts (including
punctuation 7, for example), we have computed both
and report them separatelys.
4.2 Availability of Dictionary Information
We use two methods to obtain the set of possible
tags for any given word form (i.e., to analyze it mor-
phologically). Both methods include handling un-
known words. First, we use only information which
may be obtained automatically from the manually
annotated corpus (we call this method automatic).
This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Rat-
naparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version
from the website (see the comparison in Section 5).
However, it is not unreasonable to assume that a
larger independent dictionary exists which can help
to obtain a list of possible tags for each word form
in test data. This is what we have at our disposal
for the languages in question, since the development
of such a dictionary was part of the Multext-East
project. We can thus assume a dictionary info is
available for unknown words in the test data, i.e.,
even though there is no statistics available for them
(since they did not appear in the training data), all
possible tags for (almost 9) every test token are avail-
able. This method is referred to as independent in
the following text.
We have also used a third method of obtain-
ing a dictionary information (called mized), namely,
by using only the words from the training data,
rAnd sometimes a separate token for sentence boundary
STable 1 has been computed using all tokens. In fact, the
languages differsignificantly in the proportion ofpunctuation:
from about 18% (English) to 30% (Estonian).
9Depending on the quality of the independent dictionary.
Of course, the tagsets must match, which could be a problem
per se. Here it is simple, since the dictionaries have been
developed using the same tagsets as the tagged data.
96
but complementing the information about them ob-
tained from the training data by including all other
possible tags for such words. Therefore the net result
is that during testing, we have only training words
at our disposal, but with a complete dictionary in-
formation (as if coming from a full morphological
dictionary)1°.
The results on the full training data set are sum-
marized in Table 2.
The baseline error rate is computed as follows.
First of all, we use the independent dictionary for
obtaining the possible tags for each word. Then we
extract only the lexical information from the current
position11 and counts used for smoothing (which is
based on the ambiguity classes only and it does not
use lexical information). The system is then trained
normally, which means it uses the lexical information
only if the AC-based smoothing 12 alone does not
work. This baseline method is thus very close to the
usual baseline method of using simple conditional
distribution of tags given words.
The message of Table 2 seems to be obvious; but
before we jump to conclusions, let's present another
set of experiments.
In view of the recent interest in dealing with
"small languages", and with regard to the questions
of cost-effectiveness of using "human" resources (i.e.
annotation vs. rule-writing vs. tools development
etc.), we have also performed experiments with re-
duced training data size (but with an enriched fea-
ture pool - by lowering thresholds, adding more of
the "general features" as described above, etc. - as
allowed by reasonable time/space constraints). 13
These results are summarized in Table 3 (using
only the dictionary derived from the training data),
Table 4 (using words from training data with mor-
phological information complemented from a dictio-
nary) and Table 5 (using the "independent" dictio-
nary). In all cases, we again count only true words
(no punctuation). Accordingly, the major POS er-
ror rate is reported, too (12 POS tags to be dis-
tinguished only: Noun, Verb, Adjective.... ; see Ta-
bles 6, 7, and 8).
1°This arrangement removes the "closed vocabulary" phe-
nomenon from the test data, since for the Multext-East data,
we did not have a truly independent vocabulary available.
11Words from the training data which are not singletons
(freq > 1) are used. Surprisingly enough, it would not hurt
to use them too. We believeit is due to the smoothing method
used. Even though this is valid only for the baseline experi-
ment, we haveobserved in general that this form of exponen-
tial model (with error-driven training, that is) is remarkably
resistant to overtrainlng.
12UsingACs linearly interpolated with global unigram sub-
tag distribution and finally the uniform distribution.
13Byreasonable we mean less than a day of CPU for train-
ing.

4.3 Tagger Comparison
The work (Erjavec et al., 1999) consistently com-
pares several taggers (HMM, Brill's Transformation-
based Tagger, Ratnaparkhi's Maximum Entropy
tagger, and the Daelemans et al.'s Memory-based
Tagger) on Slovene. We have chosen the Maximum
Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a compari-
son with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by
a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene
as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of tag-
gers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not
freely available to us at the time of writing). We
have trained and tested the Maximum Entropy Tag-
ger on exactly the same data, using the off-the-shelf
(java binary only) version.
The results are compared in Table 9.
Since we want to show how a tagger accuracy is
influenced by the amount of training data available,
we have run a series of experiments comparing the
results of the exponential tagger to the maximum
entropy tagger when there is only a limited amount
of data available. The results are summarized in
Table 10. Since the public version of the MaxEnt
tagger cannot be modified to take advantage of nei-
ther the mixed nor the independent dictionary, we
have compared it only to the automatic dictionary
version of the exponential tagger. To save space,
the results are tabulated only for the training data
sizes of 2000, 5000 and 20000 words. Again, only
the "true" word error rate is reported.
As the tables show, for the languages we tested,
the exponential, feature-based tagger we adapted
from (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1998) achieves similar re-
sults as the Maximum Entropy tagger 14 15. (using
exactly the same (full) training data; the "score"
is 3:3, with the MaxEnt tagger being substantially
better on English; probably the development lan-
14Otherwise the acknowledged leader in English tagging
15Theonly substantial difference we noticed was in tagging
speed. The runtime speed ofthe MaxEnt tagger is lower,only
about 10 words per second vs. almost 500 words per second;
it should be noted however that we are comparing MaxEnt's
java bytecode and C.

guage bias shows herein). However, when the train-
ing data size goes down, the advantage of predicting
the single morphological categories separately favors
the exponential tagger (with the notable and sub-
stantial exception of English). The less data, the
larger the difference (Tab 10).
16Onthe other hand, the Exponential tagger has been de-
veloped on Czech originally and it lost on this language. It
should be noted that the original version of the exponen-
tial tagger did contain moreCzech-specificfeatures, and thus
might in fact do better.
The resulting accuracy (of both taggers) is still
unsatisfactory not only from the point of view of
results obtained on English, but also from the prac-
tical point of view: approx. 85% accuracy (Czech,
Slovene) typically means that about five out of six
10-word sentences contain at least one error in it.
That is bad news e.g. for parsing projects involving
tagging as a preliminary step.

5 Conclusions
5.1 The Differences Among Languages
The following discussion abstracts from the tagset
design, relying on the fact that the Multext-East
project has been driven by common tagset guidelines
to an unprecedented extent, given the very different
languages involved. At the same time, we acknowl-
edge that even so, their design for the individual
languages might have influenced the results. Also,
the quality of the annotation is an important factor;
we believe though that the later data we obtained
for the experiments described here are within the
range of usual human error and do not suffer from
negligence1~.
First of all, it is clear that these languages differ
substantially just by looking at the simple training
17Specifically, we are sure that the post-release Czech,
Sloveneand Hungariandata we are usingare without anno-
tation defectsbeyondthe usual occasionalannotation error,
as they have been doublechecked,and we also believethat
the other two languagesare reasonablyclean. Bulgarian,al-

data statistics, where the number of unique tags seen
in a relativelysmall collectionof about 100k tokens is
high - from 401 (Hungarian) to 1033 (Slovene); com-
pare that to English with only 139 tags. However, it
is interesting to see that the average per-token ambi-
guity is much more narrowly distributed, and in fact
English ranks 3rd (after Hungarian and Slovene),
Czech being the last with almost every other token
ambiguous on average. This ambiguity does not cor-
respond with the results obtained: Slovene, being
the second least ambiguous, is the second most dif-
ficult to tag. Only Czech behaves consistently by
tailing the pack in both cases.
5.2 Comparison to Previous Results
Any comparison is necessarily difficult due to differ-
ent evaluation methodologies, even within the "best-
only", accuracy-based reporting. Nevertheless, we
will try.
For Romanian, Tufts in his recent work (Tufts,
1999) reports 98.5% accuracy (i.e. 1.5% error rate)
on Romanian, using the classifier combination ap-
proach advocated by e.g. (Brill and Wu, 1998). His

results are well above the 3.29% error rate achieved
here (with even a larger tagset of 1391 vs. 486 here),
but the paper does not say how this number has been
computed (training data size, the all-token/words-
only question) thus making any conclusions difficult
to make. He also argues that his method is language
independent but no results are mentioned for other
languages.
For Czech, previous work achieved similar results
(6.20% on newspaper text using the all-tokens-based
error rate computation, on 160,000 training tokens;
vs. 7.04% here on approx, half that amount of train-
ing data; same handling of unknown words). This is
in line with the expectations, since the same method-
ology (tagging as well as evaluation) has been used,
except the features used in that work were specifi-
cally tuned to Czech.
The most detailed account of Slovene (Erjavec et
al., 1999) reports various results, which might not
be directly comparable because it is unclear whether
they use the all-tokens-based or words-only compu-
tation of the error rate. They report 6.421% error
rate on the full tagset on known words, and 13.583%
on all words (tokens?) including unknown words
(the exponential tagger we used achieved 13.82% on
all tokens, 16.26% on words only). They use almost
the same data (Orwell's 1984, but leaving out the
Appendices)ls. They also report that the original
Czech-specific exponential tagger used as a basis for
the work reported here achieved 7.28% error rate on
Slovene on full tags on the same data, which means
that by the changes to the exponential tagger aimed
at its language independence we introduced in Sec-
tion 3, we have not achieved any improvement (on
Slovene) of the exp. tagger (the error rate stayed at
7.26% - using all-tokens-based evaluation numbers,
dictionary available; but the data was not exactly
the same, presumably).
5.3 Dictionary vs. Training Data
This is, according to our opinion, the most interest-
ing result of the experiments described so far. As
18Their tag count is lower (1021) than here (1033), but
that's not really relevant. Theydo not report the average
ambiguityor a similar measure.
100
already Table 2 clearly suggests, even the baseline
tagging results obtained with the help of an indepen-
dent dictionary are comparable (if not better) than
the fully-trained tagger on 100k words, but without
the dictionary information. The situation is even
clearer when comparing the POS-only results: here
the "independent" dictionary results are better by
far, with almost no training data needed.
Looking at the characteristics of the languages, it
is apparent that the inflections cause the problem:
the coverage of a previously unseen text is inferior to
the usual coverage of English or another analytical
language. Therefore, unless we can come up with
a really clever way of learning rules for dealing with
previously unseen words, it is clearly strongly prefer-
able to work on a morphological dictionary19, rather
than to try to annotate more data.
6 Future Work
We would like to compare more taggers using still
other methodologies, especially the MBT tagger,
which achieved the best results on Slovene but which
was not available to us at the time of writing this
paper. Obviously, we would also like to use the clas-
sifter combination method on them, to confirm the
really surprisingly good results on Romanian and
test it on the other languages as well.
We would also like to enrich the best taggers avail-
able today (such as the Maximum Entropy tagger)
by using the dictionary information available and
compare the results with the exponential feature-
based tagger we have been using in the experiments
here.
For Czech and Slovene, the results are still far be-
low what one would like to see (in absolute terms). It
seems that the key lies in the initial feature set defi-
nition - including statistical tagset clustering, which
might potentially lead to more reliable estimates of
certain parameters while using still the same size of
training data.
19Not necessarilymanually- apparently, even a partially
supervised methodwouldbe oftremendoushelp.
