Abstract
The eventual goal of a language model is to accu-
rately predict the value of a missing word given its
context. We present an approach to word prediction
that is based on learning a representation for each
word as a function of words and linguistics pred-
icates in its context. This approach raises a few
new questions that we address. First, in order to
learn good word representations it is necessary to
use an expressive representation of the context. We
present a way that uses external knowledge to gener-
ate expressive context representations, along with a
learning method capable of handling the large num-
ber of features generated this way that can, poten-
tially, contribute to each prediction. Second, since
the number of words "competing" for each predic-
tion is large, there is a need to "focus the attention"
on a smaller subset of these. We exhibit the contri-
bution of a "focus of attention" mechanism to the
performance of the word predictor. Finally, we de-
scribe a large scale experimental study in which the
approach presented is shown to yield significant im-
provements in word prediction tasks.
1 Introduction
The task of predicting the most likely word based on
properties of its surrounding context is the archetyp-
ical prediction problem in natural language process-
ing (NLP). In many NLP tasks it is necessary to de-
termine the most likely word, part-of-speech (POS)
tag or any other token, given its history or context.
Examples include part-of speech tagging, word-sense
disambiguation, speech recognition, accent restora-
tion, word choice selection in machine translation,
context-sensitive spelling correction and identifying
discourse markers. Most approaches to these prob-
lems are based on n-gram-like modeling. Namely,
the learning methods make use of features which are
conjunctions of typically (up to) three consecutive
words or POS tags in order to derive the predictor.
In this paper we show that incorporating addi-
tional information into the learning process is very

beneficial. In particular, we provide the learner with
a rich set of features that combine the information
available in the local context along with shallow
parsing information. At the same time, we study
a learning approach that is specifically tailored for
problems in which the potential number of features
is very large but only a fairly small number of them
actually participates in the decision. Word predic-
tion experiments that we perform show significant
improvements in error rate relative to the use of the
traditional, restricted, set of features.
Background
The most influential problem in motivating statis-
tical learning application in NLP tasks is that of
word selection in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998).
There, word classifiers are derived from a probabilis-
tic language model which estimates the probability
of a sentence s using Bayes rule as the product of
conditional probabilities,
Pr(s) - =
-- H~=lPr(wi]wl,...Wi_l )
-- H?=lPr(wi[hi )
where hi is the relevant history when predicting wi.
Thus, in order to predict the most likely word in a
given context, a global estimation of the sentence
probability is derived which, in turn, is computed
by estimating the probability of each word given its
local context or history. Estimating terms of the
form Pr(wlh ) is done by assuming some generative
probabilistic model, typically using Markov or other
independence assumptions, which gives rise to es-
timating conditional probabilities of n-grams type
features (in the word or POS space). Machine learn-
ing based classifiers and maximum entropy models
which, in principle, are not restricted to features of
these forms have used them nevertheless, perhaps
under the influence of probabilistic methods (Brill,
1995; Yarowsky, 1994; Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994).
It has been argued that the information available
in the local context of each word should be aug-
mented by global sentence information and even in-
formation external to the sentence in order to learn
124
\x0cbetter classifiers and language models. Efforts in
this directions consists of (1) directly adding syn-
tactic information, as in (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998;
Rosenfeld, 1996), and (2) indirectly adding syntac-
tic and semantic information, via similarity models;
in this case n-gram type features are used when-
ever possible, and when they cannot be used (due
to data sparsity), additional information compiled
into a similarity measure is used (Dagan et al.,
1999). Nevertheless, the efforts in this direction so
far have shown very insignificant improvements, if
any (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996).
We believe that the main reason for that is that in-
corporating information sources in NLP needs to be
coupled with a learning approach that is suitable for
it.
Studies have shown that both machine learning
and probabilistic learning methods used in NLP
make decisions using a linear decision surface over
the feature space (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999). In this
view, the feature space consists of simple functions
(e.g., n-grams) over the the original data so as to
allow for expressive enough representations using a
simple functional form (e.g., a linear function). This
implies that the number of potential features that
the learning stage needs to consider may be very
large, and may grow rapidly when increasing the ex-
pressivity of the features. Therefore a feasible com-
putational approach needs to be feature-efficient. It
needs to tolerate a large number of potential features
in the sense that the number of examples required
for it to converge should depend mostly on the num-
ber features relevant to the decision, rather than on
the number of potential features.
This paper addresses the two issues mentioned
above. It presents a rich set of features that is con-
structed using information readily available in the
sentence along with shallow parsing and dependency
information. It then presents a learning approach
that can use this expressive (and potentially large)
intermediate representation and shows that it yields
a significant improvement in word error rate for the
task of word prediction.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
section 2 we formalize the problem, discuss the in-
formation sources available to the learning system
and how we use those to construct features. In sec-
tion 3 we present the learning approach, based on
the SNoW learning architecture. Section 4 presents
our experimental study and results. In section 4.4
we discuss the issue of deciding on a set of candi-
date words for each decision. Section 5 concludes
and discusses future work.
2 Information Sources and Features
Our goal is to learn a representation for each word
in terms of features which characterize the syntactic
and semantic context in which the word tends to
appear. Our features are defined as simple relations
over a collection of predicates that capture (some of)
the information available in a sentence.
2.1 Information Sources
Definition 1 Let s =< wl,w2,...,wn > be a sen-
tence in which wi is the i-th word. Let : be a col-
lection of predicates over a sentence s. IS(s)) 1, the
Information source(s) available for the sentence
s is a representation ors as a list of predicates I E :r,
XS(S) = {II(Wll , ...Wl,),-.., /~g(W~l , ..-Wk,)}.
Ji is the arity of the predicate Ij.
Example 2 Let s be the sentence
< John, X,at, the, clock, to, see, what, time, it, is >
Let ~={word, pos, subj-verb}, with the interpreta-
tion that word is a unary predicate that returns the
value of the word in its domain; pos is a unary
predicate that returns the value of the pos of the
word in its domain, in the context of the sentence;
subj- verb is a binary predicate that returns the
value of the two words in its domain if the second is
a verb in the sentence and the first is its subject; it
returns  otherwise. Then,
IS(s) = {word(wl) = John, ..., word(w3) = at,...,
word(wn) = is, pos(w4) = DET,...,
s bj - verb(w , w2) = {John, x}...}.
The IS representation of s consists only of the pred-
icates with non-empty values. E.g., pos(w6) =
modal is not part of the IS for the sentence above.
subj - verb might not exist at all in the IS even if the
predicate is available, e.g., in The ball was given
to Mary.
Clearly the IS representation of s does not contain
all the information available to a human reading s;
it captures, however, all the input that is available
to the computational process discussed in the rest
of this paper. The predicates could be generated by
any external mechanism, even a learned one. This
issue is orthogonal to the current discussion.
2.2 Generating Features
Our goal is to learn a representation for each word
of interest. Most efficient learning methods known
today and, in particular, those used in NLP, make
use of a linear decision surface over their feature
space (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999). Therefore, in or-
der to learn expressive representations one needs to
compose complex features as a function of the in-
formation sources available. A linear function ex-
pressed directly in terms of those will not be expres-
sive enough. We now define a language that allows
1We denote IS(s) as IS wherever it is obvious what the
referred sentence we is, or whenever we want to indicate In-
formation Source in general.
125
\x0cone to define "types" of features2 in terms of the
information sources available to it.
Definition 3 (Basic Features) Let I E Z be a
k-ary predicate with range R. Denote wk =
(Wjl,... , wjk). We define two basic binary relations
as follows. For a e R we define:
1 iffI(wk)=a
f(I(wk), a) = 0 otherwise (1)
An existential version of the relation is defined by:
liff3aERs.tI(w k)=a
f(I(wk),x) = 0 otherwise (2)
Features, which are defined as binary relations, can
be composed to yield more complex relations in
terms of the original predicates available in IS.
Definition 4 (Composing features) Let fl, f2
be feature definitions. Then fand(fl, f2) for(f1, f2)
fnot(fl) are defined and given the usual semantic:
liff:----h=l
fand(fl, f2) = 0 otherwise
liff:=l orf2=l
fob(f1, f2) = 0 otherwise
{ l~ffl=O
fnot(fx) = 0 otherwise
In order to learn with features generated using these
definitions as input, it is important that features
generated when applying the definitions on different
ISs are given the same identification. In this pre-
sentation we assume that the composition operator
along with the appropriate IS element (e.g., Ex. 2,
Ex. 9) are written explicitly as the identification of
the features. Some of the subtleties in defining the
output representation are addressed in (Cumby and
Roth, 2000).
2.3 Structured Features
So far we have presented features as relations over
IS(s) and allowed for Boolean composition opera-
tors. In most cases more information than just a list
of active predicates is available. We abstract this
using the notion of a structural information source
(SIS(s)) defined below. This allows richer class of
feature types to be defined.
2We note that we do not define the features will be used in
the learning process. These are going to be defined in a data
driven way given the definitions discussed here and the input
ISs. The importance of formally defining the "types" is due
to the fact that some of these are quantified. Evaluating them
on a given sentence might be computationally intractable and
a formal definition would help to flesh out the difficulties and
aid in designing the language (Cumby and Roth, 2000).
2.4 Structured Instances
Definition 5 (Structural Information Source)
Let s =< wl,w2, ...,Wn >. SIS(s)), the Structural
Information source(s) available for the sentence
s, is a tuple (s, E1,... ,Ek) of directed acyclic
graphs with s as the set of vertices and Ei \'s, a set
of edges in s.
Example 6 (Linear Structure) The simplest
SIS is the one corresponding to the linear structure
of the sentence. That is, SIS(s) = (s,E) where
(wi, wj) E E iff the word wi occurs immediately
before wj in the sentence (Figure 1 bottom left
part).
In a linear structure (s =< Wl,W2,...,Wn >,E),
where E = {(wi,wi+l);i = 1, ...n- 1}, we define
the chain
c(wj, [l, r]) = {w,_,,..., wj,.., n s.
We can now define a new set of features that
makes use of the structural information. Structural
features are defined using the SIS. When defining a
feature, the naming of nodes in s is done relative to
a distinguished node, denoted wp, which we call the
focus word of the feature. Regardless of the arity
of the features we sometimes denote the feature f
defined with respect to wp as f(wp).
Definition 7 (Proximity) Let SIS(s) = (s, E) be
the linear structure and let I E Z be a k-ary predicate
with range R. Let Wp be a focus word and C =
C(wp, [l, r]) the chain around it. Then, the proximity
features for I with respect to the chain C are defined
as:
fc(l(w), a) = {
1 ifI(w) = a,a E R,w E C
0 otherwise
(3)
The second type of feature composition defined
using the structure is a collocation operator.
Definition 8 (Collocation) Let fl,...fk be fea-
ture definitions, collocc (f l , f 2, . . . f k) is a restricted
conjunctive operator that is evaluated on a chain
C of length k in a graph. Specifically, let C =
{wj,, wj=, .. . , wjk } be a chain of length k in SIS(s).
Then, the collocation feature for fl,.., fk with re-
spect to the chain C is defined as
collocc(fl, . . . , fk) = {
1 ifVi = 1,...k, fi(wj,) = 1
0 otherwise
(4)
The following example defines features that are
used in the experiments described in Sec. 4.
126
\x0cExample 9 Let s be the sentence in Example 2. We
define some of the features with respect to the linear
structure of the sentence. The word X is used as
the focus word and a chain [-10, 10] is defined with
respect to it. The proximity features are defined with
respect to the predicate word. We get, for example:
fc(word) ----
John; fc(word) = at; fc(word) = clock.
Collocation features are defined with respect to a
chain [-2, 2] centered at the focus word X. They are
defined with respect to two basic features fl, f2 each
of which can be either f(word, a) or f(pos, a). The
resulting features include, for example:
collocc(word, word)= {John- X};
collocc(word, word) = {X - at};
collocc(word, pos) = {at- DET}.
2.5 Non-Linear Structure
So far we have described feature definitions which
make use of the linear structure of the sentence and
yield features which are not too different from stan-
dard features used in the literature e.g., n-grams
with respect to pos or word can be defined as colloc
for the appropriate chain. Consider now that we are
given a general directed acyclic graph G = (s, E)
on the the sentence s as its nodes. Given a distin-
guished focus word wp 6 s we can define a chain in
the graph as we did above for the linear structure
of the sentence. Since the definitions given above,
Def. 7 and Def. 8, were given for chains they would
apply for any chain in any graph. This generaliza-
tion becomes interesting if we are given a graph that
represents a more involved structure of the sentence.
Consider, for example the graph DG(s) in Fig-
ure 1. DG(s) described the dependency graph of
the sentence s. An edge (wi,wj) in DG(s) repre-
sent a dependency between the two words. In our
feature generation language we separate the infor-
mation provided by the dependency grammar 3 to
two parts. The structural information, provided in
the left side of Figure 1, is used to generate SIS(s).
The labels on the edges are used as predicates and
are part of IS(s). Notice that some authors (Yuret,
1998; Berger and Printz, 1998) have used the struc-
tural information, but have not used the information
given by the labels on the edges as we do.
The following example defines features that are
used in the experiments described in Sec. 4.
Example 10 Let s be the sentence in Figure 1
along with its IS that is defined using the predicates
word, pos, sub j, obj, aux_vrb. A sub j-verb
3This information can be produced by a functional de-
pendency grammar (FDG), which assigns each word a spe-
cificfunction, and then structures the sentence hierarchically
based on it, as we do here (Tapanainen and Jrvinen, 1997),
but can also be generated by an external rule-based parser or
a learned one.
feature, fsubj-verb, can be defined as a collocation
over chains constructed with respect to the focus
word join. Moreover, we can define fsubj-verb to
be active also when there is an aux_vrb between
the subj and verb, by defining it as a disjunction
of two collocation features, the sub j-verb and the
subj-aux_vrb-verb. Other features that we use are
conjunctions of words that occur before the focus
verb (here: join) along all the chains it occurs in
(here: will, board, as) and collocations of obj
and verb.
As a final comment on feature generation, we note
that the language presented is used to define "types"
of features. These are instantiated in a data driven
way given input sentences. A large number of fea-
tures is created in this way, most of which might not
be relevant to the decision at hand; thus, this pro-
cess needs to be followed by a learning process that
can learn in the presence of these many features.
3 The Learning Approach
Our experimental investigation is done using the
SNo W learning system (Roth, 1998). Earlier ver-
sions of SNoW (Roth, 1998; Golding and Roth,
1999; Roth and Zelenko, 1998; Munoz et al., 1999)
have been applied successfully to several natural lan-
guage related tasks. Here we use SNo W for the task
of word prediction; a representation is learned for
each word of interest, and these compete at evalua-
tion time to determine the prediction.
3.1 The SNOW Architecture
The SNo W architecture is a sparse network of linear
units over a common pre-defined or incrementally
learned feature space. It is specifically tailored for
learning in domains in which the potential number of
features might be very large but only a small subset
of them is actually relevant to the decision made.
Nodes in the input layer of the network represent
simple relations on the input sentence and are being
used as the input features. Target nodes represent
words that are of interest; in the case studied here,
each of the word candidates for prediction is repre-
sented as a target node. An input sentence, along
with a designated word of interest in it, is mapped
into a set of features which are active in it; this rep-
resentation is presented to the input layer of SNoW
and propagates to the target nodes. Target nodes
are linked via weighted edges to (some of) the input
features. Let At = {Q,... , i,~} be the set of features
that are active in an example and are linked to the
target node t. Then the linear unit corresponding to
t is active iff
t
E wi > Ot,
iEAt
where w~ is the weight on the edge connecting the ith
feature to the target node t, and Ot is the threshold

Figure 1: A sentence with a linear and a dependency grammar structure
for the target node t. In this way, SNo W provides
a collection of word representations rather than just
discriminators.
A given example is treated autonomously by each
target subnetwork; an example labeled t may be
treated as a positive example by the subnetwork
for t and as a negative example by the rest of the
target nodes. The learning policy is on-line and
mistake-driven; several update rules can be used
within SNOW. The most successful update rule is
a variant of Littlestone\'s Winnow update rule (Lit-
tlestone, 1988), a multiplicative update rule that is
tailored to the situation in which the set of input
features is not known a priori, as in the infinite
attribute model (Blum, 1992). This mechanism is
implemented via the sparse architecture of SNOW.
That is, (1) input features are allocated in a data
driven way - an input node for the feature i is al-
located only if the feature i was active in any input
sentence and (2) a link (i.e., a non-zero weight) ex-
ists between a target node t and a feature i if and
only if i was active in an example labeled t.
One of the important properties of the sparse ar-
chitecture is that the complexity of processing an
example depends only on the number of features ac-
tive in it, na, and is independent of the total num-
ber of features, nt, observed over the life time of the
system. This is important in domains in which the
total number of features is very large, but only a
small number of them is active in each example.
4 Experimental Study
4.1 Task definition
The experiments were conducted with four goals in
mind:
1. To compare mistake driven algorithms with
naive Bayes, trigram with backoff and a simple
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) base-
line.
2. To create a set of experiments which is compa-
rable with similar experiments that were previ-
ously conducted by other researchers.
3. To build a baseline for two types of extensions of
the simple use of linear features: (i) Non-Linear
features (ii) Automatic focus of attention.
4. To evaluate word prediction as a simple lan-
guage model.
We chose the verb prediction task which is sim-
ilar to other word prediction tasks (e.g.,(Golding
and Roth, 1999)) and, in particular, follows the
paradigm in (Lee and Pereira, 1999; Dagan et al.,
1999; Lee, 1999). There, a list of the confusion sets is
constructed first, each consists of two different verbs.
The verb vl is coupled with v2 provided that they
occur equally likely in the corpus. In the test set,
every occurrence of vl or v2 was replaced by a set
{vl, v2} and the classification task was to predict the
correct verb. For example, if a confusion set is cre-
ated for the verbs "make" and "sell", then the data
is altered as follows:
Once target subnetworks have been learned and
the network is being evaluated, a decision sup-
port mechanism is employed, which selects the
dominant active target node in the SNoW unit
via a winner-take-all mechanism to produce a fi-
nal prediction. SNoW is available publicly at
http ://L2R. cs. uiuc. edu/- cogcomp, html.
make the paper --+ {make,sell} the paper
sell sensitive data --~ {make,sell} sensitive data
The evaluated predictor chooses which of the two
verbs is more likely to occur in the current sentence.
In choosing the prediction task in this way, we
make sure the task in difficult by choosing between
128
\x0ccompeting words that have the same prior proba-
bilities and have the same part of speech. A fur-
ther advantage of this paradigm is that in future
experiments we may choose the candidate verbs so
that they have the same sub-categorization, pho-
netic transcription, etc. in order to imitate the first
phase of language modeling used in creating can-
didates for the prediction task. Moreover, the pre-
transformed data provides the correct answer so that
(i) it is easy to generate training data; no supervi-
sion is required, and (ii) it is easy to evaluate the
results assuming that the most appropriate word is
provided in the original text.
Results are evaluated using word-error rate
(WER). Namely, every time we predict the wrong
word it is counted as a mistake.
4.2 Data
We used the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of the years
88-89. The size of our corpus is about 1,000,000
words. The corpus was divided into 80% training
and 20% test. The training and the test data were
processed by the FDG parser (Tapanainen and Jrvi-
nen, 1997). Only verbs that occur at least 50 times
in the corpus were chosen. This resulted in 278 verbs
that we split into 139 confusion sets as above. Af-
ter filtering the examples of verbs which were not in
any of the sets we use 73, 184 training examples and
19,852 test examples.
4.3 Results
4.3.1 Features
In order to test the advantages of different feature
sets we conducted experiments using the following
features sets:
1. Linear features: proximity of window size 4-10
words, conjunction of size 2 using window size
4-2. The conjunction combines words and parts
of speech.
2. Linear + Non linear features: using the lin-
ear features defined in (1) along with non
linear features that use the predicates sub j,
obj, word, pos, the collocations subj-verb,
verb-obj linked to the focus verb via the graph
structure and conjunction of 2 linked words.
The over all number of features we have generated
for all 278 target verbs was around 400,000. In all
tables below the NB columns represent results of the
naive Bayes algorithm as implemented within SNoW
and the SNoW column represents the results of the
sparse Winnow algorithm within SNOW.
Table 1 summarizes the results of the experiments
with the features sets (1), (2) above. The baseline
experiment uses MLE, the majority predictor. In
addition, we conducted the same experiment using
trigram with backoff and the WER is 29.3%. From

these results we conclude that using more expressive
features helps significantly in reducing the WER.
However, one can use those types of features only
if the learning method handles large number of pos-
sible features. This emphasizes the importance of
the new learning method.

of improvement in accuracy over the baseline.
Table 2 compares our method to methods that use
similarity measures (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999).
Since we could not use the same corpus as in those
experiments, we compare the ratio of improvement
and not the WER. The baseline in this studies is
different, but other than that the experiments are
identical. We show an improvement over the best
similarity method. Furthermore, we train using only
73,184 examples while (Dagan et al., 1999) train
using 587, 833 examples. Given our experience with
our approach on other data sets we conjecture that
we could have improved the results further had we
used that many training examples.
4.4 Focus of attention
SNoW is used in our experiments as a multi-class
predictor - a representation is learned for each word
in a given set and, at evaluation time, one of these
is selected as the prediction. The set of candidate
words is called the confusion set (Golding and Roth,
1999). Let C be the set of all target words. In previ-
ous experiments we generated artificially subsets of
size 2 of C in order to evaluate the performance of
our methods. In general, however, the question of
determining a good set of candidates is interesting in
it own right. In the absence, of a good method, one
might end up choosing a verb from among a larger
set of candidates. We would like to study the effects
this issue has on the performance of our method.
In principle, instead of working with a single large
confusion set C, it might be possible to,split C into
subsets of smaller size. This process, which we call
the focus of attention (FOA) would be beneficial
only if we can guarantee that, with high probability,
129
\x0cgiven a prediction task, we know which confusion
set to use, so that the true target belongs to it. In
fact, the FOA problem can be discussed separately
for the training and test stages.
1. Training: Given our training policy (Sec. 3) ev-
ery positive example serves as a negative exam-
ple to all other targets in its confusion set. For
a large set C training might become computa-
tionally infeasible.
2. Testing: considering only a small set of words
as candidates at evaluation time increases the
baseline and might be significant from the point
of view of accuracy and efficiency.
To evaluate the advantage of reducing the size of
the confusion set in the training and test phases, we
conducted the following experiments using the same
features set (linear features as in Table 1).

words.
"Train All" means training on all 278 targets to-
gether. "Test all" means that the confusion set is
of size 278 and includes all the targets. The results
shown in Table 3 suggest that, in terms of accuracy,
the significant factor is the confusion set size in the
test stage. The effect of the confusion set size on
training is minimal (although it does affect training
time). We note that for the naive Bayes algorithm
the notion of negative examples does not exist, and
therefore regardless of the size of confusion set in
training, it learns exactly the same representations.
Thus, in the NB column, the confusion set size in
training makes no difference.
The application in which a word predictor is used
might give a partial solution to the FOA problem.
For example, given a prediction task in the context
of speech recognition the phonemes that constitute
the word might be known and thus suggest a way
to generate a small confusion set to be used when
evaluating the predictors.
Tables 4,5 present the results of using artificially
simulated speech recognizer using a method of gen-
eral phonetic classes. That is, instead of transcrib-
ing a word by the phoneme, the word is transcribed
by the phoneme classes(Jurafsky and Martin, 200).
Specifically, these experiments deviate from the task
definition given above. The confusion sets used are
of different sizes and they consist of verbs with dif-
ferent prior probabilities in the corpus. Two sets of
experiments were conducted that use the phonetic
transcription of the words to generate confusion sets.

Error Rate for Training and testing with
confusion sets determined based on phonetic
classes (PC) from a simulated speech recog-
nizer.
In the first experiment (Table 4), the transcription
of each word is given by the broad phonetic groups
to which the phonemes belong i.e., nasals, fricative,
etc.4. For example, the word "b_u_y" is transcribed
using phonemes as "b_Y" and here we transcribe it
as "P_VI" which stands for "Plosive_Vowell". This
partition results in a partition of the set of verbs
into several confusions sets. A few of these confusion
sets consist of a single word and therefore have 100%
baseline, which explains the high baseline.

Table 5: Simulating Speech Recognizer: Word
Error Rate for Training and testing with
confusion sets determined based on phonetic
classes (PC) from a simulated speech recog-
nizer. In this case only confusion sets that
have less than 98% baseline are used, which
explains the overall lower baseline.
Table 5 presents the results of a similar exper-
iment in which only confusion sets with multiple
words were used, resulting in a lower baseline.
As before, Train All means that training is done
with all 278 targets together while Train PC means
that the PC confusion sets were used also in train-
ing. We note that for the case of SNOW, used here
with the sparse Winnow algorithm, that size of the
confusion set in training has some, although small,
effect. The reason is that when the training is done
with all the target words, each target word repre-
sentation with all the examples in which it does not
occur are used as negative examples. When a smaller
confusion set is used the negative examples are more
likely to be "true" negative.
5 Conclusion
This paper presents a new approach to word predic-
tion tasks. For each word of interest, a word repre-
sentation is learned as a function of a common, but

into two different groups to account for different sounds.

\x0cpotentially very large set of expressive (relational)
features. Given a prediction task (a sentence with
a missing word) the word representations are evalu-
ated on it and compete for the most likely word to
complete the sentence.
We have described a language that allows one to
define expressive feature types and have exhibited
experimentally the advantage of using those on word
prediction task. We have argued that the success of
this approach hinges on the combination of using a
large set of expressive features along with a learning
approach that can tolerate it and converges quickly
despite the large dimensionality of the data. We
believe that this approach would be useful for other
disambiguation tasks in NLP.
We have also presented a preliminary study of a
reduction in the confusion set size and its effects
on the prediction performance. In future work we
intend to study ways that determine the appropriate
confusion set in a way to makes use of the current
task properties.
